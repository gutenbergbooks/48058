<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>I <small>HAVE</small> the pleasure to present to the Hakluyt
Society, in the accompanying volume, the first two
historians who wrote on the conquest of the Rio de
la Plata, which took place in the reign of Charles V,
King of Spain and Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>The first of these was a German, a native of Straubing,
in Bavaria, whose name was Ulrich Schmidt.
The second was a Spaniard, native of Jerez de la
Frontera in Andalusia, named Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, better
known by the surname which he took from his
mother, Do&ntilde;a Teresa Cabeza de Vaca. This Alvar
Nu&ntilde;ez was a grandson of Don Pedro Vera, who, in
the time of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholics,
undertook to conquer the Canary Islands at his own
cost. As his means, however, were insufficient for
so great an enterprise, he borrowed money of a
Moorish banker upon pledge. The security given by
this inhuman father consisted of his two sons, the
younger of whom was the father of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez;
and this transaction, characteristic of a soldier in
those semi-barbarous times, seemed to presage the
singular adventures in which the son of the latter
was destined to take part.</p>

<p>Of the German&rsquo;s lineage nothing is known. I
believe him to have been an obscure individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">-&nbsp;xiv&nbsp;-</a></span>
servant or agent, like the modern <i>commis voyageurs</i>
or commercial travellers, for one of the wealthy
houses of commerce established at Seville in the time
of the Emperor, and concerning which I shall have
something to say by-and-by.</p>

<p>Both the German adventurer as well as the Andalusian
cavalier gave their names to the narratives of
what happened to them in America, in the two
books published together in the present volume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Twelve years after the discovery of the river
Plate in 1516, by Juan Diaz de Solis, two Spanish
expeditions explored its shores. One of these had
been sent out by the Emperor to India, under the
orders of Sebastian Cabot, and the other, under the
command of the pilot Diego Garcia, to take possession
of that river. Cabot altered his course and went
up the Paran&aacute; till he arrived at the Rio Paraguai
in 1527, and Garcia made the same voyage the following
year. Both these navigators shortly afterwards
returned to Spain, having only left a small
colony at Sancti Spiritus, in the neighbourhood of the
present city of Rosario, which was soon transferred
to Iguape, on the Atlantic coast, very near the limit
fixed, by the treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, between
the possessions of Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>When Cabot returned to Spain in 1530, and told
of the pieces of silver he had seen among the Indians
of the Chaco, the King of Portugal sent Martin
Affonso de Souza to establish himself in the extreme
south of his possessions in Brazil; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">-&nbsp;xv&nbsp;-</a></span>
Portuguese captain, after examining the coast of
the ocean as far as the entrance of the Rio de la
Plata, founded at the close of the year 1531, in the
island of San Vicente, the first regular colony on
that coast where now stands the little city of
Santos.</p>

<p>The vicinity of these two rival colonies&mdash;the much
smaller Spanish one of Iguape, and the stronger Portuguese
one in San Vicente&mdash;endangered the peaceful
and tranquil possession of those lands; and for this
reason the Spanish Government resolved on sending
immediately a formal expedition which should
permanently occupy the north of the territory
belonging to it, according to the above-mentioned
treaty, on that coast. This expedition was placed
under the orders of the first Adelantado and Captain-General
of the province of Rio de la Plata,
Don Pedro de Mendoza.</p>

<p>With him sailed a ship belonging to some Flemish
merchants established in Seville, and in this vessel
went their servant, or agent, one Ulrich Schmidt,
a native of Bavaria, whom the Spaniards called
Schmidel, a name which was Latinized, according to
the custom of that time, into Uldericus Faber.</p>

<p>This Bavarian remained in the province of the
Rio de la Plata some twenty years, taking an active,
though obscure, part in the events of the Spanish
conquest of that part of America. In December
1552, he returned to his native country, visiting
Seville in September of the following year, and
Antwerp in January 1554. Thirteen years afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">-&nbsp;xvi&nbsp;-</a></span>
there appeared in Germany, in a collection
of voyages published at Frankfort-on-Maine by
Sebastian Franck, a narrative of Schmidt&rsquo;s voyage
under the following title:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warhafftige und liebliche Beschreibung etlicher
f&uuml;rnemen Indianischen Landschafften und Insulen,
die vormals in keiner Chronicken gedacht, und
erstlich in der schiffart Ulrici Schmidts von Straubingen,
mit grosser gefahr erk&uuml;ndigt, und von ihm
selber auffs fleissigst beschrieben und dargethan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the book translated into English, for the
first time, from the original German, and now published
by the Hakluyt Society. It is unnecessary
for me to say that the translation is not my work.</p>

<p>The historical period embraced by the voyage of
Schmidt extends from 1535 to 1552, and refers to
the governorship of Don Pedro de Mendoza, of his
successor, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, and to the
principal part taken in the events of that period by
Captain Domingo Martinez de Irala, under whose
orders the author of the narrative continually served.
Irala, actuated by personal ambition, defeated the
plans of Mendoza, deserted Buenos Ayres, abandoned
his second in command in the Chaco, occasioning his
death and that of all those who had accompanied him
across that great desert to the confines of Peru, and,
when the second Adelantado, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, arrived,
opposed him by intrigues and conspiracy till he
contrived to depose and send him in chains to
Spain, under the insidious and calumnious accusation
of having committed all sorts of crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">-&nbsp;xvii&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, after waiting judgment for eight
years, was acquitted, and recompensed by the king,
and to justify himself before the world he published
a narrative of the events that had happened to him
during his term of office, viz., from 1541 to 1544.</p>

<p>This record, the first published on the conquest
of the Rio de la Plata and Paraguai, appeared in
Valladolid in 1555, under the general title &ldquo;<i>Relacion
y Comentarios de Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, de lo
acaecido en las dos jornadas que hizo &agrave; las Indias</i>.&rdquo;
The <i>Relacion</i> refers to his adventures in Florida, and
was first published in 1542,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while the <i>Comentarios</i>
appeared as a second part of the new edition of his
voyages under the title just mentioned. This is the
second book contained in the present volume.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This part has been translated into English by Buckingham
Smith, and published in Washington in 1851.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Voyage</i> of Ulrich Schmidt, and the <i>Commentaries</i>
of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, are, as it were, the flint and
steel which, when struck together, produce light.</p>

<p>The work of Schmidt, which in nearly all its
details is in manifest contradiction to that of Alvar
Nu&ntilde;ez, was published twelve years after the <i>Commentaries</i>,
and was apparently written expressly to
refute them, taking up the defence of Domingo de
Irala, who is the principal figure of the picture,
and whose seditious and immoral conduct had been
denounced by Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez. The Hakluyt Society,
in bringing together these two contemporary records
of the Spanish conquest, leaves the reader to pass
his own judgment on the issues raised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">-&nbsp;xviii&nbsp;-</a></span></p>
<p>This Society had published in 1874 another narrative,
similar to that of Ulrich Schmidt, relating
to the same historical period, the voyage of Hans
Stade, also a German adventurer, who visited the
southern coast of Brazil shortly after the sedition
against Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca in Paraguai.
Though edited with notes and explanations by the
gallant Captain, afterwards Sir Richard Burton,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
these have not thrown the necessary light to show
the motive of Stade&rsquo;s voyage, nor other circumstances
essential to form a clear and precise idea
how this other German adventurer is entitled to a
place in the history of the Province of the Rio de la
Plata as well as in that of the conquest of Brazil.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Sir Richard Burton died in Trieste on the 20th October last,
while holding the office of H.B.M. Consul.</p>
</div>

<p>When Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez returned a prisoner to Spain,
the king appointed another Adelantado to replace
him and continue the Spanish colonisation from
which he had been so violently severed. This new
governor of the Rio de la Plata was Don Juan de
Sanabria, who died before starting on the voyage,
and only after many difficulties his son, Don Diego,
sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda in 1549 with
three ships. In one of these Hans Stade embarked,
on conditions identical with those under which
Ulrich Schmidt had gone to America with Don
Pedro de Mendoza. The armada of Sanabria was
dispersed on the voyage; its chief arrived at the
Antilles, and only two of the ships reached their
destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">-&nbsp;xix&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Sanabria, just like Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, bore the king&rsquo;s
orders to establish himself in the ports of the
Atlantic coast, in proximity with the Portuguese
colony of San Vicente, to take possession of the
island of Santa Catalina, to found in its neighbourhood
a colony on the border of the sea, in order to
penetrate thence by land, crossing the whole province
of Guaira, or Paran&aacute;, till he arrived at Paraguai.</p>

<p>The enterprise of Sanabria was, however, very
unfortunate. The colonists, when their resources
failed them, divided. A considerable number took
refuge in the colony of San Vicente, impelled by
necessity, and seduced by the Portuguese governor,
Thom&eacute; de Souza. Hans Stade went with these,
and as he understood something of gunnery, abandoned
the Spaniards, and entered the Portuguese
service as an artilleryman, when his chiefs and companions
returned to Spanish territory and founded
the colony of San Francisco, in 26&deg; 20&prime; of south
latitude.</p>

<p>The first seventeen chapters of Stade&rsquo;s book refer
to his stay in the province of Sanabria; the remainder
to the time he passed in San Vicente, and
his captivity among the Tupis who inhabited the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>These three books are, as it were, fragments of
the history of the first few years of the conquest of
one part of South America. The series, arranged
chronologically, is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">-&nbsp;xx&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

  <li>2. <i>The Commentaries of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez</i>, from 1541 to 1544;</li>
  <li>3. <i>The Captivity of Hans Stade</i>, from 1547 to 1554.</li>
</ul>

<p>The special merit of these three works is that
their authors were eye-witnesses and actors in the
events they narrate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has seemed to me interesting and necessary to
add to this volume an ethnographical map, which
shows what were the indigenous tribes which occupied
the country described by Schmidt, and the
places in which the Guaran&iacute; family lived in that
part of the province of Rio de la Plata, colonised in
those days by the Spaniards. This map also shows,
for the first time in the history of cartography, the
demarcation of this same province entrusted by the
King of Spain to his Adelantados, or governors, and
the route opened by Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca
on his journey from the island of Santa Catalina to
Asuncion, on the Paraguai.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The name of Rio de la Plata, given by the King
of Spain to a territory so vast, and differing so
widely now from what it was at the time of the
conquest, creates some confusion and uncertainty in
the mind of the reader of the events of that period.
This can only be removed by a map which shows
clearly what territories were held by the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">-&nbsp;xxi&nbsp;-</a></span>
and Portuguese by virtue of the treaty of Tordesillas.
Those who are cognisant of it are but few
in number. When speaking or writing of the conquest
of America, it is generally believed that the
only title upon which were based the conquests of
Spain and Portugal was the famous Papal Bull of
partition of the Ocean, of 1493. Few modern authors
take into consideration that this Bull was amended,
upon the petition of the King of Portugal, by the
above-mentioned treaty, signed by both Powers in
1494, augmenting the portion assigned to the Portuguese
in the partition made between them of the
continent of America. The arc of meridian fixed
by this treaty as a dividing line, which gave rise,
owing to the ignorance of that age, to so many
diplomatic congresses and interminable controversies,
may now be traced by any student of
elementary mathematics. This line is shown on
the accompanying map, and runs along the meridian
of 47&deg; 32&prime; 56&Prime; west of Greenwich. The
coast of the South American continent between
the equator and the vicinity of the Tropic of
Capricorn describes a great curve, closed on the
west by the aforesaid dividing line, which enters
the sea a little south of San Vicente, or Santos.
West of this line were the Spanish possessions.
A clear understanding on this point removes the
confusion occurring at the present day, when the
situation of affairs has undergone so marked a
change, and explains how it is that Don Pedro de
Mendoza, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, and Hans Stade remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">-&nbsp;xxii&nbsp;-</a></span>
at points of the coast called of Brazil, mentioned
by those travellers; and how Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, without
leaving the province under his jurisdiction and
command, marched through Spanish territory, from
Santa Catalina, across the whole of Guaira, or province
of Paran&aacute;, to Asuncion on the Paraguai.
The name &ldquo;Brazil&rdquo;, or &ldquo;tierra del Brasil&rdquo;, at that
time referred only to the part of the continent
producing the dyewood so-called. Nearly two centuries
later the Portuguese advanced towards the
south, and the name &ldquo;Brazil&rdquo; then covered the new
possessions they were acquiring, thus introducing the
confusion to which I have referred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Voyage of Schmidt</i> went through several
editions, all incorrect, and rendered more so by
the so-called elucidations and notes by their early
editors. It was translated and published in Latin,
English, Spanish, and other languages. These translations,
however, were not made directly from the
German, in which it was written, and thus the inaccuracies
contained in the original were increased
as they were turned into other idioms by persons
who had no knowledge of the history, nor the
slightest notion of the language spoken by the
natives of America.</p>

<p>The first translation was done into Latin by
Professor Gotard Arthus, for Theodore de Bry&rsquo;s
<i>Collection of Voyages</i>, 1597; and when Levinus
Hulsius prepared his collection, in 1599, he found
so many defects in it, that, instead of adopting it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">-&nbsp;xxiii&nbsp;-</a></span>
he preferred translating it afresh. This version, in
which there are many alterations and suppressions
of the original text, must in justice be described as
not less defective than the preceding one, without,
however, being quite so bad. The Latin version of
Hulsius served for the subsequent translations into
modern languages&mdash;for instance, for that inserted by
Purchas in his <i>Pilgrims</i>.</p>

<p>From the same collection of Hulsius the work of
Schmidt was translated from Latin into Spanish by
Dr. Andreas Gonzalez de Barcia, and published with
his insignificant and incorrect notes in Madrid, 1737,
in his <i>Coleccion de Historiadores Primitivos de las
Indias Occidentales</i>. This is the version reproduced
at Buenos Ayres a century later by Don Pedro de
Angelis, compiler and editor of the manuscripts of
the Argentine canon, Don Saturnino Segurola.</p>

<p>The translation now published by the Hakluyt
Society, done directly from the original German, has
the merit of presenting the work genuine and entire
as it left the author&rsquo;s hands. And as he was led
into many errors of fact, proper names, geography,
and chronology, the Society has done me the honour
to ask me to explain them by notes and this brief
Introduction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The expedition of Don Pedro de Mendoza to the
Rio de la Plata, and all the events referred to by
Ulrich Schmidt, belong to the epoch of Charles V,
Emperor of Germany and King of Spain. Although
he was the son of a Spanish prince, this monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">-&nbsp;xxiv&nbsp;-</a></span>
was born at Ghent, and had been educated by
Flemings. His ministers, his counsellors, the
bankers who supplied him with the funds for his
wars, were Flemings. Great was the favour enjoyed
in Spain and Portugal by those very wealthy
bankers and merchants, Fugger and Welzer of
Augsburg, and Erasmus Schetzen of Antwerp.
The first two had opened branches of their business
at Seville, the centre at that time of trade with
America, and the third had done the same at
Lisbon, the metropolis of the Portuguese colonies in
the Indies. The house of Erasmus Schetzen, as
Hans Stade tells us, had sugar factories in the
recently colonised captaincy of San Vicente, since
converted into the province of San Pablo. One of
his agents, Peter Rosel, had established himself
there, and had acquired, in the name of Erasmus,
the great factory established by the grantee, Captain-Major
Martin Affonso de Souza, together with other
partners.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Charles V had made a gift of the whole
province of Caracas to the bankers Welzer, and the
affairs of the Fuggers were so vast that the family
name was adopted into the Castilian vernacular
as <i>fucar</i>, explained by the dictionary of the language
to signify a person of great wealth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Capitania de S. Vicente</i>, 1797.</p>
</div>

<p>Charles V had inaugurated his reign by showing
his partiality for the Flemings, by whom he was
surrounded, bestowing on the Baron de la Bresa, his
counsellor and majordomo mayor, the first contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">-&nbsp;xxv&nbsp;-</a></span>
for the exclusive privilege of introducing negro
slaves into the West Indies, against the advice of
his Spanish counsellors, who rejected the project of
the famous protector of the Indians, Bartholom&eacute; de
las Casas.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These favours shown to the Flemings
gave rise to that picturesque phrase of Pedro Martyr
de Anghiera, that the Flemings had gone with
Charles V to Spain to destroy the vine after
having gathered the vintage.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This explains how the Spanish Government,
exclusive and jealous of all foreign interference in
its affairs in the Indies, allowed Germans and
Flemings, with their vessels, their merchandise, and
their men, to take part in such considerable numbers
in the expedition of Don Pedro de Mendoza. The
Flemings were at that time as much Charles&rsquo;s
subjects as the Spaniards, and the owners of the
ships in which Schmidt and his countrymen sailed,
were bankers&mdash;allies and favourites<!--was favourities--> of the young
Emperor.</p>

<p>It appears that Schmidt was not enlisted among
the soldiers of Mendoza, but came as an <i>employ&eacute;</i> of
the house of Welzer and Niedhart, who owned the
vessel which took him. Its factor was the Fleming
Heinrich Paine, and it was manned by eighty
Germans. The cargo was destined to exchange for
the silver which Sebastian Cabot, after his recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">-&nbsp;xxvi&nbsp;-</a></span>
voyage of discovery, had made it believed in Spain,
abounded among the Indians he had encountered on
the Paraguai. The Rio de Solis then took the
name of Rio de la Plata, and it was this magic
word that raised the desires of so many in Spain
to take part in the expedition of Don Pedro de
Mendoza, that it was necessary to close the lists of
applicants and hasten the departure of the armada,
in order to calm the fever of emigration which
prevailed on this occasion among persons desirous of
making their fortunes rapidly. This expedition, as
the historian Fernandez de Oviedo, who saw it sail
from Seville, expressed it, &ldquo;was a company fit to
make a goodly show in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s army and in any
part of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Pedro de Mendoza began by establishing
himself in the port of Los Patos, at the southern
extremity of the island of Santa Catalina, which
was included in his jurisdiction, as may be seen on
the accompanying map. He then passed to the
Rio de la Plata, and, on the 11th June 1535, laid
the foundations of the city of Santa Maria de
Buenos Aires. Soon afterwards he nominated as
his second in command his intimate friend, Juan de
Ayolas, and sent him with a detachment to explore
the Rio Paran&aacute;, and open a road by means of this
river to the Pacific Ocean, which was the advance
or front limit of his province.</p>

<p>The brigantines, or little feluccas in which the
explorer Ayolas set forth, were under the orders of
the Biscayan, Domingo Martinez de Irala, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">-&nbsp;xxvii&nbsp;-</a></span>
company went Schmidt, but it is unknown in what
character. In his book he acquaints us with the
events that happened to that expedition, and all
those in which he took part, almost always in the
company of his captain, Irala, with whose fortunes
he linked his own from the beginning. Our only
authority for this statement is the adventurer himself
who has given his name to the book. I know
of no document mentioning Schmidt, nor is he
noticed by the chronicler Francisco Lopez de
Gomara, by his successor, Antonio de Herrera, in
his history of the Indies, or by Ruy Diaz de Guzman,
himself born on the Paraguai, a grandson of
Domingo Martinez de Irala, or, finally, by Alvar
Nu&ntilde;ez in his <i>Commentaries</i>.</p>

<p>Schmidt relates that he was present at the foundation
of Buenos Aires and its desertion six years
afterwards, by order of Irala, who possessed himself
of the command after the deaths of Don Pedro de
Mendoza and his lieutenant Ayolas. Schmidt was
also present at the events which took place during
the governorship of the second Adelantado, Alvar
Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, from 1541 to 1544. He
assisted at his violent overthrow and deportation
under the direction of Irala, made all the journeys
of exploration which, starting from Asuncion, ascended
the Rio Paraguai to Matto Grosso, and
explored all the country of the Cheriguanos, now
known by the name of Moxos and Chiquitos, to the
confines of Peru. He remained with Irala till the
arrival on the Atlantic coast of the expedition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">-&nbsp;xxviii&nbsp;-</a></span>
Adelantado Sanabria, with whom Hans Stade sailed
to America.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty years of travels and strange
adventures, of combats with Indians, of anarchy,
poverty, and disorder among the conquerors of
Paraguai, when Domingo de Irala, by force of
audacity and machiavelism, had definitely possessed
himself of the government of this unfortunate
colony, obtaining, a short while afterwards, the royal
title of Governor, his faithful and inseparable companion
Schmidt received a letter from the banker
Niedhart, transmitted to him from Seville by the
agent there of the wealthy Fugger, in which he
begged him to return to Antwerp. Schmidt obtained
leave of absence from his chief, set out on
his journey, with six deserters and twenty of his
Indian slaves, by the rivers Paraguai and Paran&aacute;
to the river Iguaz&uacute;, and thence crossed the province
of Guaira by the route opened by Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez,
arriving at the Portuguese colony of San Vicente.
Here he met with the agent of Erasmus Schetzen,
who gave him a passage to Lisbon in a vessel
belonging to his principal, which was laden with a
cargo of sugar and brazil wood. Schmidt landed at
Antwerp on the 25th January 1554, as I have
already said.</p>

<p>Hans Stade was a prisoner of the Tapiis, or Tupis,
in the immediate vicinity of San Vicente, when
Schmidt passed that way on his homeward journey,
and only succeeded in obtaining his liberty one year
later, embarking at Rio de Janeiro on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">-&nbsp;xxix&nbsp;-</a></span>
French ships which trafficked with the Indians
occupying that magnificent bay. His adventures
during his captivity were published at Marburg in
1557. It is very strange, therefore, that Schmidt
should not make the slightest mention of his
countryman, though he also was acquainted with
Peter Rosel, agent of Erasmus Schetzen, in the
Portuguese colony. It would seem most natural
that they should have spoken on the misfortunes
that had befallen Stade, and on the various fruitless
efforts made to rescue him from captivity, and as to
the means to be employed in order to restore him to
his country. Not a word of all this do we find in
Schmidt&rsquo;s narrative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The voyage of Ulrich Schmidt to the Rio de la
Plata was published, as we have seen, at Frankfort-on-Maine
in 1567, in the collection of Sebastian
Franck, wherein also appeared for the second time
that of Stade, side by side with his countryman
Schmidt&rsquo;s. This proves the interest taken in these
narratives of travel in those days of theological controversies
and religious wars, when the French Protestants
were trying to set foot in Brazil, while
Villegaignon, under the protection of Coligny, was
taking possession of the port of Rio de Janeiro, one
year after the abdication of Charles V and the accession
to the throne of the sombre Philip II, whose
tyranny became very soon insupportable in the Low
Countries, which fell under his dominion by inheritance
from his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">-&nbsp;xxx&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The publication of these travels answered to
the propaganda against Spain and the religious
principles her soldiers were taking to the New
World. The work of Stade had been written
by Dr. Johann Dryandri, Professor of the University
of Marburg, the centre of the ideas of
Luther. That of Schmidt was adopted and published
by his countryman, Sebastian Franck, who
was a vehement Anabaptist, and by the Flemings
de Bry and his friend Hulsius, one of the most
active advocates of Church Reform, expelled from
Ghent, his native place, by decree of the King of
Spain during the most critical period of the struggle
maintained by the Flemings for their national independence
and their religious beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

and Travels edited and printed by Levinus Hulsius</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>In those times there existed no periodical press
or newspaper. The Spanish Government did not
expose to the criticism of the world its colonial
policy; silence was its inviolable rule. Availing
himself of the right of his own defence, the Adelantado,
Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, deposed and
accused by Irala and his party, had published, as we
have seen, the narrative of his Government of the
Rio de la Plata. Immediately afterwards there
appeared in Germany the book of Ulrich Schmidt, containing
the charges against Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez and the
defence of the conduct of his enemy. These conquerors
of Paraguai accused one another of disgraceful
immorality and incapacity for the enterprize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">-&nbsp;xxxi&nbsp;-</a></span>
entrusted to them by the King. Ambition, as we
gather from these books, overcame in them all
feelings of honour and duty; and violence, sedition,
perfidy, and bloodshed, were the means by which
they sought to attain their ends.</p>

<p>The publication of these recriminations in Protestant
Europe, which looked on with fear at the
growth of the power of Spain by her conquests in
the Indies, was a natural incentive to those who
groaned under her yoke. Having no periodical
press, they availed themselves of the narratives of
voyages, which were awakening curiosity with respect
to countries that had fallen under her dominion.
Everything for them was new and wonderful. The
unknown races, their primitive customs, their savage
life, their nakedness, their arms and food, the virgin
nature and splendid vegetation of the tropics, the
fruits and new animals, the game and fish, differing
from those in the old world, all excited the imagination,
and, at the same time, opened a vast field for
censure, and for inciting the multitude against the
enemy who was taking possession with such admirable
ease of the new lands which raised the enthusiasm
of the first discoverer to such a pitch that he
believed they had contained the earthly Paradise.</p>

<p>How could they help devouring with avidity
&ldquo;the veritable historie and description of a country
belonging to the wild, naked, savage, man-eating
people&rdquo;, narrated by Hans Stade, who had been
their captive? How could they fail to be interested
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">-&nbsp;xxxii&nbsp;-</a></span> &ldquo;the true and agreeable description of some
Indian lands and islands which have not been recorded
in former chronicles&rdquo;, by one who, like
Schmidt, had first explored them &ldquo;amid great
danger&rdquo;?</p>

<p>It seems to me impossible that in the class of people
to which Schmidt and Stade belonged, there should
have been found men capable of writing narratives,
though of scant literary merit. The art of writing
was very uncommon in the middle of the sixteenth
century. We know by whom Stade&rsquo;s work was
prepared; but we have not the same information
with regard to that of Schmidt, though there can
be no doubt that both were written, not by those
who appear as their authors, but by more learned
persons, enemies to the Spanish Government,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> upon
data recorded, badly or well, by the adventurers
themselves, and from what they heard from their
travelling companions.</p>

<p>The memory cannot retain for a long time names,
and especially foreign names, and details of events
happening in the midst of grave anxieties and
dangers. For this reason Schmidt and Stade, who
could not have taken notes at the time, ran into
such great errors, that it is impossible to correct
them with accuracy. The Castilian language is
difficult to pronounce for men of Northern Europe,
and much more is this the case with the Guaran&iacute;,
which abounds with vowels and inarticulate sounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">-&nbsp;xxxiii&nbsp;-</a></span>
with an accent at times guttural, at others nasal, or
both combined. The Spanish Jesuit missionaries
found themselves obliged to invent signs to represent
these sounds. Nevertheless, there are words
which, although pronounced in accordance with
these signs, are now unintelligible to the natives.</p>

<p>It seems to me beyond all doubt that Guaran&iacute;
was the general language of the whole of America
to the east of the Cordillera of the Andes, from the
sea of the Antilles to the extreme south of the continent.
There were various dialects, as might be
expected in a language without a literature, spoken
by tribes living apart and hostile to one another.
Traces of it occur north of the Amazon, as well as
in the pampas of Argentina, and especially in Paraguai
and in Guaira, the chief centre of the race in
the days of the Spanish conquest. In Paraguai and
its immediate vicinity the tongue spoken is nearly
as pure as in the time of the Spanish missionaries
Anchieta and Ruiz de Montoya, who wrote the
vocabulary, and tried to adapt the language to
grammatical principles and rules.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the numerous notes I have placed at the foot
of the pages, I have corrected the errors of Guaran&iacute;
nomenclature committed by Schmidt, whenever they
bear some resemblance to the true names of tribes
and places referred to. Some errors were noticed
by L. Hulsius (or Hulse) in 1599, who indicated
those of well-known places and names, which in the
first German edition appeared disfigured. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">-&nbsp;xxxiv&nbsp;-</a></span>
&ldquo;Demerieffe&rdquo; for &ldquo;Tenerife&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Petrus
Manchossa&rdquo; for &ldquo;Don Pedro de Mendoza&rdquo;. But
neither Hulsius nor the other editors could correct
them accurately, because they did not know a single
word of the language of the natives, nor of that of
their Spanish conquerors. These errors are still
greater in the Latin version from which the Spanish
and other translations were made.</p>

<p>The errors of Schmidt went so far in names of
persons that he did not write correctly those of his
chiefs, not even that of Domingo Martinez de Irala,
under whose immediate orders he served for twenty
years. Schmidt repeatedly insists on naming him
Martino Domingo de Eyollas. Another of his
chiefs was Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, whom he
always names Abernunzo Cabessa de Bacha. The
most curious thing is, that the editors who attempted
to correct these errors, were not free from
similar faults; even M. Camus,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who, in correcting
that of Cabeza de Vaca, rendered it by Alvare
Nugnez Cabera di Vacha; and M. Ternaux Compans,
who supposed the settlement named &ldquo;Duechkamin&rdquo;
by Schmidt, to be Tucuman,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> because he did
not know that neither the city nor the province of
this name were founded at the moment to which he
is referring.</p>

<p>In all this, and in chronology, the work of
Schmidt is extremely defective, so much so, that I
am unable to understand how the Spanish geographer
Azara, recommending the merits of this adventurer,
should have affirmed the following enormity in his

do not accept this judgment, and in my notes and
observations the reader will see if I have good
reason for differing from Azara, whose merits I
recognise, as I also know his grave faults.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10" href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> <i>Voyages dans l&rsquo;Am&eacute;rique M&eacute;ridionale</i>, par Don Felix Azara;
Paris, 1809; Introduction, p. 20.</p>
</div>

<p>Azara is one of the few who deny that the country
was inhabited by a multitude of various nations, as
many writers have asserted, and nevertheless enumerates
and describes no less than thirty-two nations
and more than fifty tribes. I maintain there was
only one nation, the Guaran&iacute;; and in the province
of La Plata, described by Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez and by
Schmidt, the Guaran&iacute;s were divided into twenty-one
tribes, who differed only in their habits, or their
arms, or in the nature of the country inhabited by
them. These are the tribes entered on my ethnographical
map. The others, mentioned by the
writers in question, would be merely unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">-&nbsp;xxxvi&nbsp;-</a></span>
groups, designated by the name of their chief, or by
some nickname applied to them by their neighbours
or enemies. The tribes I record are the following:
Qu&icirc;rand&iacute;s, Chan&aacute;s, Charuas, Yar&oacute;s, Arechan&eacute;s,
Minhu&aacute;nos, Timb&uacute;s, Tobas, Mocob&iacute;s or Mbocoys,
Abipones, Agaces, Mepenes, Mbai&aacute;s, Payagu&aacute;s,
Guaicur&uacute;s, Cheriguanos, Xarayos, Itatines, Guat&oacute;s,
Cariy&oacute;s, Tapiis; all these are Guaran&iacute;s. I do not
treat of the other principal tribes, situated in the
interior of the country between Paran&aacute; and the
Andes, because they do not concern the narratives
of Schmidt and Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the errors of Schmidt in nomenclature and
distances must be added others of fact, doubtless
more important. These also are rectified in the
notes, which the reader will find in the corresponding
place. In these, however, I have not
touched on the subject of cannibalism attributed
to the natives, because this deserves separate treatment
here.</p>

<p>I believe there is not a single author of history
and travel, at the time of the conquest of America,
who has not admitted the assertion, and repeated it,
that the natives were <i>anthropophagi</i>. Even the
name <i>cannibals</i> was invented in the early years of
the conquest. When Christopher Columbus established
himself in Hayti, he asked the feeble, unarmed,
and hospitable Indians he found there, for
some information concerning other islands and their
inhabitants, and they informed him that further on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">-&nbsp;xxxvii&nbsp;-</a></span>
there were perverse men who made war upon them
to rob and enslave them. These Indians of Hayti
gave the name of <i>Carib</i> and <i>Caniba</i> to the islands
inhabited by their enemies, called <i>Caribes</i>.</p>

<p>Columbus says, in the unique autograph document
that is known concerning his first voyage of discovery,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
that these Indians are held in all the islands
to be very fierce, and that they eat <i>live flesh</i> (<i>carne
viva</i>). He considers them, however, on the whole,
equal to the others. This is the first origin of the
tale of cannibalism, for the letter of Columbus, in
which this statement is made, was immediately
translated into Latin and published at Rome, and in
this translation the Spanish words, <i>comer carne viva</i>,
were interpreted by the Latin phrase, <i>carne humana
vescuntur</i>. Long afterwards (from 1527 to 1559)
the celebrated Bartholom&eacute; de las Casas wrote his
<i>Historia de las Indias</i>, in which he gave an abstract
of the journal of Columbus&rsquo; first voyage. In his
summary, Las Casas relates what Columbus says,
amplifying, correcting, or abridging, as he found
convenient; and there the great discoverer appears
repeatedly speaking of Indians who ate human
flesh.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11" href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Letter of the Admiral Christopher Columbus to Luis de Sant&aacute;ngel,
Contador Mayor de los Reyes Catholicos. (Navarrete
<i>Coleccion de Viages</i>, tomo i, p. 167.) An identical letter was
addressed by Columbus to the Contador Rafael Sanchez.</p>
</div>

<p>This alteration of the text of the letter of
Columbus was repeated by the conquistadores and
missionaries to justify the enslaving of the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">-&nbsp;xxxviii&nbsp;-</a></span>
and the horrible cruelty with which they were
treated, commending in this way their perils and
their labours in the military and spiritual conquest.</p>

<p>Cannibalism, under its name of <i>Anthropophagy</i>,
originated with the fable of Polyphemus, and I am
convinced that it is a calumny spread abroad from
the time of Saint Jerome, when this brutality was
attributed to the Scotch, down to the present day,
when it is asserted that there are cannibals in
Oceania and Africa.</p>

<p>I do not say this in defence of the Indians, but for
the honour of human nature, not so bad as the
creative genius of poets and authors of fiction have
supposed it to be. That barbarous Indians are
treacherous; that when they slay their enemies
they will tear them to pieces and burn them, is
beyond dispute. But that they will eat their flesh
is a slander and a despicable falsehood founded
on interested motives. I have yet to find the
man who will tell me in good faith he has seen
the Indians eat human flesh. Schmidt does not
say it, nor does Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, nor any other of the
historians of America, though all repeat the tale;
and there are some who, even at the present day,
believe that the Fuegians, those unhappy savages of
the extreme south of the continent, are cannibals.</p>

<p>In my new historical work, shortly to be given to
the press, I shall treat of this interesting subject
more at large; for the present I limit myself to the
denial of a deed which I could only credit were I to
see it with my own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">-&nbsp;xxxix&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>These tales of cannibals and of Amazons, of giants
and of pygmies, met with by certain travellers in
unknown countries, are the brilliant spangles wherewith
to dazzle the eyes of the vulgar anxious for
marvels, and disposed to believe that in other parts
there are men with tails, and women warriors who
live without men, and monsters which have only
existed in mythology and in fable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I hope the readers of this Introduction, and of
the notes, will be indulgent with respect to style,
bearing in mind that what they read is a translation
from the Spanish language in which I write.</p>

<p>I cannot terminate without giving my thanks to
Mr. E. Delmar Morgan, Honorary Secretary of the
Hakluyt Society, for the active co-operation he has
afforded me in the preparation of this work.</p>

ULRICH SCHMIDT.</h3>

<p>U<small>LRICH</small> S<small>CHMIDT&rsquo;S</small> voyage to the River Plate was published
for the first time, in a Collection of Voyages, edited by the
booksellers, Sebastian Franck and Sigismund Feyerabend, in
the middle of the 16th century, at Frankfort-on-Main. The
title of this collection is:</p>

<p>The next edition was published, in 1599, by de Bry in his
great collection known as <i>Grands et Petits Voyages</i>, which

<p>This book was reprinted by Hulsius in 1602 at Nurnberg,

<p>There are 16 plates in the British Museum copy, but the
map and two plates are missing. In this edition, dedicated
to Johann Philip, Bishop of Bamberg, the following epilogue
occurs:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">-&nbsp;xliv&nbsp;-</a></span> &ldquo;And so after the lapse of twenty years, through

misery, care and anxiety, sufficiently made known and set
forth in this historical narrative. I say therefore let praise,
honour and thanks be given to Almighty God who has
helped me to come back once more so happily to the place
whence I full twenty years before had started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in the Latin edition of this same collection, a new

<p>The dividing line between Spanish and Portuguese territories in

degrees of longitude from that drawn by M. Adolpho de
Varnhagen in his <i>Historia Geral do Brazil</i>. The question
about the present boundary of those territories has been settled
by modern treaties.</p>

<p>It must also be remarked that the boundaries of the ancient
<i>Province of Rio de la Plata</i>, in 1534, were very soon modified by
the Spanish Government, who did the same thing by the four
other Provinces into which the Continent of South America south
of the equator was divided in that year.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the first place, when setting forth from Antorff,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
I came in fourteen days to Hispania, to
a town called Calles,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to which one reckons
four hundred miles by sea. I saw before that
town a balena, or whale, thirty-five paces long, out of which
thirty tuns&mdash;of the capacity of herring tuns&mdash;of fat had
been extracted.</p>

</div>

<p>Near the said town of Calles there were fourteen great
ships, well provided with all ammunitions and necessaries,
which intended to voyage to Riodellaplata<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in India. Also
there were two thousand five hundred Spaniards and one
hundred and fifty Germans, Netherlanders, and Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
And our chief captain was called Petrus Manchossa.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

Mendoza&rsquo;s expedition was composed of 800 men, very good and
distinguished people, and eleven ships. Others state that there were
1,500 and 1,700 men. Schmidt alone states the number as 2,650. By
his contract with the Government, Mendoza was bound to take with
him one thousand men in two voyages.</p>

<p>Among these fourteen ships, one belonged to Messrs.
Sebastian Neidhart and Jacob Welser, from N&uuml;rnberg, who
had sent their factor, Heinrich Paeime, with merchandise to
Riodellaplata. With these and others, as Germans and
Netherlanders, about eighty men, armed with arquebuses
and muskets, I went to Riodellaplata.</p>

<p>As we were now come there,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> we set out from Sibylla<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
with the said gentlemen and the chief captain, in the aforesaid
year, on the day of S. Bartholomew, and came to a town
in Spain called S. Lucas<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which is twenty miles&rsquo; distance
from Sibylla. There we were compelled, on account of much
blustering winds, to stay till the first of September of the
year before-named (1534).</p>

</div>

<p>And when we departed from there we fell in with three
islands, which lie near to one another, the first of which is
called Demerieff, the other Kumero, the third Palman,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
from the town of S. Lucas to these islands there is a space of
about twenty miles.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> At these islands the ships parted
company. These islands belong to their Imperial Majesties,
and are inhabited only by Spaniards, with their wives and
children. And there sugar is made. We came with three
ships to Palman, and remained there for four weeks, replenishing
our store of victual.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21" href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> From San Lucar to the Canary Islands there are about 500 English
miles.</p>
</div>

<p>But afterwards our chief captain, Petrus Manchossa, being
at a distance of eight to nine miles from us, and having
commanded us to make sail, we having on board our ship
our captain&rsquo;s cousin, J&ouml;rg Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who had fallen in
love with the daughter of a burgher of Palma, and inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-</a></span>
as we were going to leave on the following day, the said
J&ouml;rg Manchossa went ashore that very night, at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
with twelve of his good companions, and brought secretly
with them, out of the island Palma, the said burgher&rsquo;s daughter
and her maid-servant, with all their clothes and jewels,
and money also, and came aboard again, but secretly, to the
intent that neither our captain, nor the aforesaid agent, nor
anybody else on the ship might know aught about it; only
the watch saw them, for it was about midnight. And as we
were intending to depart from there in the morning, and
were only about two or three miles away, a mighty wind
sprang up, so that we needs must turn back to the same
harbour, where we were lying before. When we there cast
anchor, our captain, the aforesaid Heinrich Paine, would go
aland in a small vessel, which is called pat or podell (<i>bote</i>).
And as he went, and was about to land, there were awaiting
him more than thirty men, armed with arquebuses, spears, and
halberds with the intention of taking him, the said Heinrich
Paine. At the same time one of his crew besought him not to
land, but to return to the ship, which advice the captain would
have gladly followed, but that he could not, seeing that the
men on land had come too near to him in another little ship,
which they had in readiness; however, he escaped at length
in another ship which was near the land. When the armed
men saw that the others did not fire upon, nor could take
the captain Heinrich Paine, they caused the town of Palma
to sound the alarm, swiftly loaded two great guns, and
fired four shots at our ship (which lay not far off from the
land). With the first shot they breached our earthen pot,
which was on the poop and full of fresh water, whereby five
or six pails of water were lost. Secondly, they shot in pieces
also the mizzen, that is, the hindmost mast nearest the stern.
Thirdly, they shot in the waist of the ship a big hole whereby
a man was struck and killed. But with the fourth shot
they missed us.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22" href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Jorge de Mendoza. No known document mentions this Jorge de
Mendoza, nor the rape alluded to by Schmidt. It is not likely that a
relative of the chief of the expedition should have been on board a
Flemish ship which was not under his immediate command.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>There was also another captain, whose ship was lying by
our side, and who intended to sail for Nova Hispania, in
Mechseckheim<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; he was on shore with one hundred and
fifty men, who, when he knew of our quarrel, made peace
between us and those of the town, on condition that J&ouml;rg
Manchossa<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the burgher&rsquo;s daughter and her maid-servant
should certainly be delivered into their hands.</p>

</div>

<p>Then the stadthalter, and the judge, our captain, and the
captain spoken of above, came aboard our ship, intending to
make prisoners J&ouml;rg Manchossa and his paramour.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Thereupon
he answered them that she was his wife, and she
did not show herself in another light and they soon got
married; the father, however, was very sorry and anxious,
and our ship was through them badly treated by the firing
at it. After all this, we left J&ouml;rg Manchossa and his wife
ashore, for our captain would not have them any longer on
board his ship.</p>

</div>

<p>Now we again made ready our ship, and sailed to an
island or land, the name whereof is S. Jacob, or, in Spanish,
Sancte Augo (Santiago); there is a town belonging to the
King of Portugal; the Portuguese entertain that town, and
the Blackamoors are their subjects: this town is at a distance
of three hundred miles from the said Island Palman, from
which we sailed.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> We remained there five days, and again
furnished our ship with new and fresh victual, as bread,
meat, water, and all that necessity demands at sea. The whole
fleet, namely, fourteen ships, were now once more together.
We then went again to sea and sailed for two whole months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-&nbsp;5&nbsp;-</a></span>
and then arrived at an island wherein there was nothing
else than birds, in such quantities that we killed them with
sticks. Here we lay three days. This island is entirely uninhabited;
it is in length and breadth about six miles either
way, and is distant from the above-mentioned island, <i>S. Augo</i>,
whence we sailed, fifteen hundred miles. In this sea there
are flying-fishes and other marvellous great fishes of the
balena kind, and great fishes called <i>schaubhut</i>, for that
they wear on their heads a large trencher, with which
they may become dangerous in fighting with other fishes;
it is a wondrous great and evil fish. There are also other
fishes which have on their backs a knife of whalebone, and
are called in the Spanish tongue <i>Peschespate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and furthermore,
other fishes which have on their backs a saw of whalebone,
and are also evil fishes; their name is <i>Peschedeferre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and also there are several other rare fishes whose form,
size, and other features I cannot at this time describe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26" href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> All distances given by Schmidt are erroneous, and it is astonishing
that Don Felix de Azara, a geographer, should have written to the
contrary. By the distance given in miles between Palma, one of the
Canary Islands, and St. Iago, one of the Cape Verd Islands, it may be
seen that Schmidt&rsquo;s miles are more properly <i>Castilian leagues</i> of 17&frac12; in
a geographical degree, the legal measure of distance in his time.</p>

</div>

<p>Afterwards we sailed from this island to another, named
Riogenea,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> at a distance of five hundred miles from the
former, belonging to the King of Portugal; this is the island
Riogenea in India, and the Indians are called Toppis.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> We
lay there about fourteen days. There Petrus Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
our chief captain, ordered Hans Ossorig,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> as his sworn brother,
to take the command over us in his stead, forasmuch as he
was always melancholy, weak, and ill. But he, Hans
Ossorig, very soon was belied and ill-spoken of to Petrus
Manchossa, his sworn brother, even as though he had in his
mind to cause a mutiny among the people against Petrus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-&nbsp;6&nbsp;-</a></span>
Manchossa, the chief captain. Thereupon he, Petrus Manchossa,
ordered four other captains, named Johann Eyollas,
Johan Salleisser, J&ouml;rg Luchsam,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and Lazarum Salvaischo,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
that the aforesaid Johan Ossorig should be killed with a
dagger or otherwise put to death, and should be exposed in
the midst of the place as a traitor; and besides he ordered
and proclaimed to the effect that no one should dare to pity
Ossorig, for that he himself, whoever he might be, would
meet with no better fate. Yet Ossorig was treated wrongly,
God Almighty knows it, and may He be merciful to
him, for he was a pious, fair-dealing, and valiant warrior,
and kept well all the warriors.</p>

</div>

<p>From there we sailed to Riodellaplata, and came into a
river<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> called Paranau Wassu,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which is in width at its
mouth, where one leaves the sea,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> twenty-four miles. And
from Riogenea to this river there is the space of five hundred
miles. There we came to a haven, the name whereof is S.
Gabriel, and there, in the said river Paranau, we anchored the
fourteen ships.</p>

<p>As we were constrained to ride at a gunshot&rsquo;s distance
from shore with the great ships, our chief captain, Petrus
Manchossa<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> ordered to set the people ashore in the small
ships, which are for that purpose intended, and are, therefore,
called pat or podel.</p>

</div>

<p>So by the grace of God we arrived at Riodellaplata,
Anno 1535, and found there an Indian place inhabited by
about two thousand people, named Zechurias,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-&nbsp;7&nbsp;-</a></span>
nothing to eat but fish and meat. These, on our arrival
did leave the place, and fled away with their wives and
children, so that we could not find them. This Indian
people go quite naked, the women having only their privities
covered, from the navel to the knees, with a small piece of
cotton cloth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39" href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Char&uacute;as.</p>
</div>

<p>Now the captain, Petrus Manchossa, commanded to bring
the people into the ships again, and to convey them to the
other side of the Paranau, where it is not broader than eight
miles.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

was founded there are 29 English miles.</p>
</div>

<p>There we built a new town and called it <i>Bonas Aeieres</i>,
that is, in German, <i>Guter Wind</i>.</p>

<p>We also brought from Hispania on board the fourteen
ships seventy-two horses and mares.</p>

<p>Here, also, we found a place inhabited by Indian folk,
named Carendies,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> numbering about three thousand people,
including wives and children, and they were clothed in the
same way as the Zechurias, from the navel to the knees.
They brought us fish and meat to eat. These Carendies have
no houses, but wander about, as do the Gipsies with us at
home, and in summer they oftentimes travel upwards of
thirty miles on dry land without finding a single drop of
water to drink.</p>

<p>And when they meet with deer or other wild beasts, (when
they have killed them) they drink their blood. Also if they
find a root, called Cardes,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> they eat it to slack their thirst.
This&mdash;namely, that they drink blood&mdash;only happens because
they cannot have any water, and that they might peradventure
die of thirst.</p>

<p>These Carendies brought us daily their provision of fish
and meat to our camp, and did so for a fortnight, and they
did only fail once to come to us. So our captain, Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</a></span>
Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> sent to them, the Carendies, a judge, named Johan
Pabon, with two foot-soldiers, for they were at a distance of
four miles from our camp. When they came near to them,
they were all three beaten black and blue, and were then
sent back again to our camp. Petrus Manchossa, our
captain, hearing of this from the judge&rsquo;s report (who for
this cause raised a tumult about it in our camp), sent Diego
Manchossa, his own brother, against them with three
hundred foot-soldiers and thirty well-armed mounted men,
of whom I also was one, straightway charging us to
kill or take prisoners all these Indian Carendies and to
take possession of their settlement. But when we came
near them there were now some four thousand men, for
they had assembled all their friends. And when we were
about to attack them, they defended themselves in such
a way that we had that very day our hands full. They also
killed our commander, Diego Manchossa, and six noblemen.
Of our foot-soldiers and mounted men over twenty were
slain, and on their side about one thousand. Thus did they
defend themselves valiantly against us, so that indeed we
felt it.</p>

<p>The said Carendies<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> use for their defence hand-bows and
tardes<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which are made in the shape of half-pikes, and the
head of them is made out of flint-stone, like a flash; they
have also bullets made out of stone with a long piece of
string attached to them, of the size of our leaden bullets at
home in Germany.</p>

<p>They throw such bullets round the feet of a horse or a
deer, causing it to fall; it is also with these bullets that they
killed our commander and the noblemen, as I have seen it
done myself, but the foot-soldiers were killed by the aforesaid
tardes.</p>

<p>Thus God Almighty graciously gave us the victory, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-&nbsp;9&nbsp;-</a></span>
allowed us to take possession of their place; but we did not
take prisoner any of the Indians, and their wives and
children also fled away from the place before we attacked
them.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> At this place of theirs we found nothing but furrier-work
made from marten or so-called otter; also much fish,
fish meal, and fish fat. There we remained three days and then
returned to our camp, leaving on the spot one hundred of our
men, in order that they might fish with the Indians&rsquo; nets for
the providing of our folk, because there was there very good
fishing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46" href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> This fight with the Quirandis took place at a few miles&rsquo; distance
from Buenos Ayres, on the banks of the river which since then is called
<i>de la Matanza</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Every one received only six half-ounces of wheaten flour
a day, and one fish every third day. The fishing lasted for
two months, and if one would eat a fish over and above
one&rsquo;s allowance, one had to go four miles for it.</p>

<p>And when we returned again to our camp, our folk were
divided into those who were to be soldiers, and the others
workers, so as to have all of them employed. And a town
was built there, and an earthern wall, half a pike high, around
it, and inside of it a strong house for our chief captain. The
town wall was three foot broad, but that which was built
to-day fell to pieces the day after, for the people had
nothing to eat, and were starved with hunger, so that they
suffered great poverty, and it became so bad that the horses
could not go. Yea, finally, there was such want and misery
for hunger&rsquo;s sake, that there were neither rats, nor mice, nor
snakes to still the great dreadful hunger and unspeakable
poverty, and shoes and leather were resorted to for eating
and everything else.</p>

<p>It happened that three Spaniards stole a horse, and ate it
secretly, but when it was known, they were imprisoned and
interrogated under the torture. Whereupon, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-&nbsp;10&nbsp;-</a></span>
they admitted their guilt, they were sentenced to death by
the gallows, and all three were hanged.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, at night, three other Spaniards
came to the gallows to the three hanging men, and hacked off
their thighs and pieces of their flesh, and took them home
to still their hunger.</p>

<p>A Spaniard also ate his brother, who died in the city of
Bonas Aeieres.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47" href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> All this is exaggerated and incredible, though accepted as true by
the pseudo-poet, Barco Centenera, in his <i>Argentina</i> poem.</p>
</div>

<p>Now our chief captain, Petrus Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> saw that he
could not any longer keep his men there, so he ordered and
took counsel with his head men that four little ships (called
Parchkadienes<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>) should be made ready, which must he rowed,
and three more yet smaller ones, which are called podell or
patt.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49" href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Brigantines.</p>
</div>

<p>And when these seven little vessels were ready and
equipped, our chief captain ordered all the people to assemble,
and sent George Lauchstein<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> with three hundred and fifty
armed men up the river Paranau in order to find out the
Indians and so obtain victual and provisions. But as soon as
the Indians were aware of us, they wrought us the most
abominable piece of knavery, by burning and destroying all
their victual and provisions and their villages, and then all
took to flight; in consequence whereof we had nothing to
eat but three ounces of bread a day. One half of our
people died during this voyage through hunger, therefore we
had to return again to the said place, where was our chief
captain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50" href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> George Lujan.</p>
</div>

<p>Petrus Manchossa desired to have a relation from George
Lauchstein, our commander, as to the circumstances of our
voyage, why so few of them had returned, since they had
only been absent for five months. To whom our commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-&nbsp;11&nbsp;-</a></span>
answered thus: the people died for hunger, since the Indians
burnt all the provisions, and then took to flight, as has been
related before.</p>

<p>After all this we remained still another month together in
great poverty in the town of Bonas Aeieres, until the ships
were prepared.</p>

<p>At this time the Indians came in great power and force,
as many as twenty-three thousand men, against us and our
town Bonas Aeieres. There were four nations of them,
namely, Carendies, Zechurias, Zechuas, and Diembus.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> They
all meant to go about to destroy us all. But God Almighty
preserved the greater part of us, therefore praise and thanks
be to Him always and everlastingly, for on our side not more
than about thirty men, including commanders and ensign,
were slain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51" href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Quirandis, Char&uacute;as, and Timbus.</p>
</div>

<p>And when they first came to our town, Bonas Aeieres, and
attacked us, some of them tried to storm the place, others
shot fiery arrows at our houses, which, being covered with
straw (only the house of our chief captain, covered with tiles,
excepted), were set on fire, and so the whole town was burnt
down. Their arrows are made out of cane, and carry fire
on their points.</p>

<p>They have also a kind of wood, out of which they also
make arrows, which, being lighted and shot off, do not
extinguish, but also set fire to all houses made out of straw.</p>

<p>Moreover they burnt down four great ships which were
half-a-mile distant from us on the river. The people who were
there, and who had no guns, hearing such great tumult of
the Indians, fled out of these four ships into three others
which were not far from these, and did contain cannon.</p>

<p>But seeing the four ships burning that were lighted by
the Indians, the Christians set themselves on defence and
fired at the Indians, who becoming aware of this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-&nbsp;12&nbsp;-</a></span>
hearing the firing, soon departed from thence and left the
Christians alone. All this happened on St. John&rsquo;s Day,
Anno 1535.</p>

<p>All this having thus happened, our people had to return
into the ships again, and Petrus Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> our chief captain,
gave the command to Johann Eyollas,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and put him in
his place to be our commander and rule us. But when Eyollas
mustered the people, he found no more than five hundred
and sixty men who were yet alive, out of two thousand five
hundred, the others being dead and having been starved for
hunger. God Almighty be gracious and merciful to them
and to us. Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>Johann Eyollas, our commander, now ordered eight
small ships, Parchkadienes and Podells, to be made ready,
and took with him on these ships four hundred men out
of the five hundred and sixty, leaving the others, namely,
one hundred and sixty men, in the four great ships to guard
them, and he gave them a commander, named Johann Romero,
and left them victual for one year, so that each soldier
might have four ounces of bread or flour daily; he who
wanted more was at liberty to find it.</p>

<p>When all this had been done and arranged as here
described, Johann Eyollas<a name="FNanchor_53_53_2" id="FNanchor_53_53_2" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the four hundred men
sailed with the Parchkadienes and the Podells<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> up the river
Paranau, and Petrus Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_52_52_2" id="FNanchor_52_52_2" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> our chief captain, sailed
with us, and in two months&rsquo; time we reached the Indians, at
a distance of eighty-four miles. These people are called
Tyembus<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; they wear on either nostril a small star,
made out of white and blue stones. The men are tall of
stature and erect, but the women, on the contrary, young
and old, are very deformed, having all the lower part of
their faces scratched, and always bloody. These people
have nothing else to eat, and have all their lives through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-&nbsp;13&nbsp;-</a></span>
lived upon nothing else but fish and meat. They are
reckoned to be fifteen thousand strong, or more. And when
we came to about four miles&rsquo; distance from this people they
took notice of us, and came to meet us in sign of peace, with
over four hundred canoes, in each of which were sixteen men.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54" href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Brigantines and boats.</p>

</div>

<p>Such a skiff is made out of a single tree, eighty feet long
and three feet wide, and must be rowed as the fishermen&rsquo;s
boats in Germany, only that the oars are not bound with iron.</p>

<p>When we met them on the water, our commander, Johann
Eyollas, presented the chief of the Tyembus Indians, Zchera
Wassu,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> with a shirt, a red cap, a hatchet, and several
other things. After this, Zchera Wassu went with us to
their place, and gave us there fish and meat in abundance.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>But if this said journey of ours had lasted ten more days,
we would all have died of hunger, for even without that,
fifty men out of four hundred who came in the ships had
already died on this journey. But in this danger God
mercifully helped us, be He praised and thanked for it.</p>

<p>In this said place we abode four years, but our chief
captain, Petrus Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> who was full of infirmities, and
was unable to move his hands or his feet, and who had spent
during this voyage forty thousand ducats of his own in cash,
could not remain any longer with us, and he sailed off in two
small Parchkadienes to Bonas Aeieres to the four great ships,
and took two of them with fifty men and sailed for Hispania.
But when he was come nearly half-way, the hand of the
Almighty so smote him that he died miserably. May God
be merciful to him!</p>

</div>

<p>But before his departure he had promised us to send
two other ships to Riodellaplata, as soon as he himself or
the ships should arrive in Spain, and this was faithfully
laid down in his will. Accordingly, when the two ships
arrived in Spain, and the councillors of His Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-&nbsp;14&nbsp;-</a></span>
Majesty were informed of this, they speedily, in the name
of His Majesty, sent two ships with people, provisions, and
merchandise, and all necessaries, to Riodellaplata.</p>

<p>The commander of these two ships was called Alvanzo
Gabrero,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who brought with him also about two hundred
Spaniards and provisions for two years. He arrived at
Bonas Aeieres (where the two other ships had been left) in
the year 1539, with one hundred and sixty men.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58" href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Alonso Cabrera.</p>
</div>

<p>The said commander, Alvanzo Gabrero, having come to the
island Thiembus, to our chief, Johann Eyollas,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> they ordered
a ship to be sent to Spain, according to the will and order of
the councillors of His Imperial Majesty, in order to report to
them how all things were situated there in that country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59" href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Juan de Ayolas.</p>
</div>

<p>Then Johann Eyollas, our chief captain, held a council
with Alvanzo Gabrero and Martin Domingo Eyolla,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
some other of his officers, and it was resolved to muster the
men. And this being done, it was found that, together with
those who had come from Spain, there were five hundred
and fifty men. Of these they took four hundred men to
themselves, leaving the other one hundred and fifty men at
Thiembus, because there were not enough ships. They gave
these men a commander, named Carolus Doberim,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> who
had been for some time page of His Imperial Majesty.</p>

</div>

<p>After this had been resolved, they sailed with these four
hundred men in eight small Parchkadienes up the river
Paranau, in order to seek out another river, called Parabor,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
where the Carios live, who have Turkish corn and a root
named Mandeochade,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and other roots such as padades<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and
mandeoch parpie, mandioch mandapore, etc. The root
padades resembles an apple, and has the same taste.
Mandeoch parpie have the taste of chestnuts. Wine is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-&nbsp;15&nbsp;-</a></span>
from mandepore,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and the Indians drink it. These Carios
have fish and meat and great sheep, as big as mules. They
also have wild boar, ostriches, and other wild beasts; also
very many hens and geese.</p>

</div>

<p>So then departing from the haven of Bonesperanso<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> with
the said eight Parchkadienes vessels, we reached the first
day, after a voyage of four miles, a nation called Curanda,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
who abstain from fish and meat, and number over twelve
thousand men, all of whom are fit for war. These people
resemble the Thiembus spoken of before; they have little
stones on their noses, and the men are tall, but the women are
hideous; young as well as old have their faces scratched and
always bloody. They are clothed like the Thiembus, from
the navel to the knee with a small cotton cloth, as was
described before. These Indians have great plenty of otter
skins; also many canoes or skiffs. They liberally parted
with us their fish, meat, and skins. We gave them in
exchange glasses, paternosters, looking-glasses, combs, knives,
and fish-hooks. We remained there two days, and then they
gave us two Carios who were their captives, to show us the
way, and help us with the language.</p>

<p>Sailing further we came afterwards to another people called
Gulgaises,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> who number forty thousand men of war and
abstain from fish and meat. These have also two little

Thiembus<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and Curandas. They dwell on a <a id="lakesix"></a>lake six miles

<p>From thence we sailed further, and during eighteen days
we did not find any people; then we came to a river flowing
inland. And there we found a great multitude of people,
called Machkuerendas.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> These eat nothing but fish and a

former, wear also two little stars (stones) on their nose,
are tall and of a good proportion; but their women are as
hideous as those before spoken of; and they are distant sixty-seven
miles from the Gulgaises.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>After having lived among them for four days, we found on
the land a marvellous great and monstrous snake five and
twenty foot long, and as thick as a man, black and yellow in
colour, which we fired at and killed. The Indians marvelled
much at seeing such a snake, for they never before had seen
such a large one. This snake, so they told us, had done much
harm to them, for when they were bathing this snake was
also in the water and it would coil its tail around one of them,
taking him under water and devouring him there, so that
oftentimes the Indians did not know what had become of
him. I myself carefully measured the length and thickness
of this snake, which the Indians cut up in pieces and carried
home with them, and having boiled and roasted it, did afterwards
eat thereof.</p>

<p>From thence we sailed up the river Paranaw for four days&rsquo;
journey, and came to a people called Zchemiaisch <a id="Saluaischo"></a>Saluaischo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-&nbsp;17&nbsp;-</a></span><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
who are small and thick set, and eat nothing but fish and
honey. These people, both men and women, young and old,
go about absolutely naked as they came into the world, so
that they have neither linen nor anything else to cover their
privities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74" href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> It is impossible even to guess at what the author means by these
words, which are not <i>Guaran&iacute;</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>They make war against the Machkuerendas. The flesh
they eat consists of deer, wild swine, ostriches, and rabbits,
which resemble rats, but without tails. This people is at a
distance of sixteen miles from the Machkuerendas, and we
made that journey in four days. We only passed the night
among them, for they themselves had nothing to eat. They
are just like our highwaymen or street-robbers at home.</p>

<p>They dwell about twenty miles away from the water, to
the intent that their enemies might not easily fall upon them.
But at this time they had come to the water five days before
we did, in order to fish and to provide themselves because
they were about to make war against the Machkuerendas.
They number two thousand men.</p>

<p>We departed thence and came to a people called Mapennis,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
who number ten thousand men. These people dwell scattered
here and there in that country, extending for the space
of forty miles either way. Yet they can all be gathered
together either on land or water in two days time. They
had more canoes or skiffs than any other people we had seen
hitherto, and in one such canoe they can carry as many as
twenty persons.</p>

</div>

<p>This people received us on the river in a hostile and war-like
manner, with five hundred canoes, but with little profit
to themselves from us, for we slew a goodly number of them
with our guns, they having never in their lives before seen
either a gun or a Christian.</p>

<p>But when we came to their houses, we could prevail
nothing against them, seeing that they were a whole mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-&nbsp;18&nbsp;-</a></span>
distant from the river Paranon<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> where our ships lay; and
all their villages were surrounded with deep water from
the lake, so that we could do them no harm, nor take
anything from them, except that we took two hundred and
fifty canoes, which we burnt and destroyed. Neither did we
dare to go too far from our ships, for we feared that they
might attack the ships from another side, therefore we
returned. The Mapennis only fight upon the water, and are
distant from the Zchemias Saluaischo, from whom we last
came, ninety-five miles.</p>

<p>From thence we sailed in eight days to a river called the
Parabor<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> which we ascended and found there a numerous
people named Kueremagbas,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> having nothing to eat but
fish and meat and St. John&rsquo;s bread,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> or the herb fenugreek,
from which also they make wine.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This people was very
kind to us, and gave us every thing of which we were in
need. They are very tall, both men and women.</p>

but the carrot-bean (Prosopis dulcis mimosa).</p>
</div>

<p>The men pierce a little hole in their nose, in which they
insert for ornament a small parrot&rsquo;s feather. The women have
long blue stripes on their cheeks which remain all their
lives through, and their privities are covered with a small
piece of cotton cloth from the navel to the knees. From
the Mapennis<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> to these Kueremagbas are forty miles; we
remained three days among them.</p>

<p>Departing thence we came to another people called Aygais,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
who also live on fish and meat. They are tall and erect.
The women are nice-looking, painted, and have their privities
covered in the same manner as explained before.</p>

</div>

<p>When we came to them, they put themselves on their
defence, and wished to make war against us by not allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-</a></span>
us to pass through. Finding this to be the case, and that
there was no help for it, we put our trust in God, and then
made our preparations to attack them by land and water; we
fought them and killed a great number&mdash;fifteen of our men
also being slain. God be merciful to them.</p>

<p>These Aygais are the best warriors that can be found on
the water, but they are not so good at fighting on land.
Before fighting, they caused their wives and children to flee
to a place of safety, and concealed their provisions and other
things. What happened to them at the last you will presently
hear. Their place is near a river called Jepedij,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
on the other side of the Parabor. It takes its source in the
mountains of Peru, near a town named Duechkamin.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
From the Kueremagbas to the Aygais there are thirty miles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83" href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> Ipiti, the name of this river, signifies &ldquo;red&rdquo; in the Guaran&iacute;
language; hence the Spaniards called it Rio Bermejo (Red River).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84" href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Neither at the time of Schmidt, nor afterwards, was there at the
head of the Bermejo a people called Duechkamin. This may, perhaps,
refer to Tomina, because, though this town is not situated within the
system of the river Bermejo, it is not far from it, and this circumstance
may have led Schmidt into error. M. Ternaux says in his
<i>Collection</i> that this town can be no other than Tucuman, but this
proves his incompetency in this matter, as Tucuman was founded
many years after Schmidt&rsquo;s voyage to the River Plate.</p>
</div>

<p>Departing from these Aygais we came to a people named
Carios, fifty miles distant from the Aygais. There, by God&rsquo;s
grace, we found plenty of Turkish corn and mandeochade,
padades, mandeochparpij, mandepore, manduris, wacheku,
etc. They have also fish and meat, deer, wild boar, ostriches,
Indian sheep, rabbits, hens and geese, also plenty of honey,
of which they make wine; and there is much cotton in the
land.</p>

<p>These Carios have a large country, nearly three hundred
miles in length and breadth; they are men of short stature,
and more able to endure work and labour than the other
natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-&nbsp;20&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The men have a little hole in their lips in which they put
yellow crystals, called in their language Parabor,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> two spans
long and of the thickness of a quill or reed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85" href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> <i>Parabor.</i> In Barcia&rsquo;s Spanish translation this word thus written
by Schmidt was changed into <i>tembet&aacute;</i>, which was the one used by the
Tapijs (Tupis). Both are Guaran&iacute; words, and they represent the same
thing; but <i>parabog</i>, or rather <i>paraog</i>, is more picturesque and accurate.
It means a cover in various colours.</p>
</div>

<p>This people, men and women, young and old, go completely
naked as God created them. Among these Indians,
the father sells his daughter, the husband his wife if she
does not please him, and the brother sells or exchanges his
sister. A woman costs a shirt or a bread knife, or a small
hoe, or some other thing of that kind.</p>

<p>These Carios also eat man&rsquo;s flesh if they can get it. For
when they make prisoners in war, male or female, they
fatten them as we do swine in Germany. But if the woman
be somewhat young and good-looking, they keep her for a
year or so, and if during that time she does not live after
their desires, they put her to death and eat her, making a
solemn banquet<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of it, and oftentimes this is combined with
a marriage. Only old persons are put to work until they
die.</p>

</div>

<p>These Carios undertake longer journeys than any nation in
the country of the Riodellaplata. They are wonderful warriors
on land. Their villages or towns are situate on hills
upon the river Paraboe<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; formerly their city was called
Lambere.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Their town is made with two wooden palisades, each piece
of timber being the thickness of a man. And one palisade
is separated from the other by a space of twelve feet; the
posts are driven down into the earth, six feet deep, and are
above the earth nearly as high as one may reach with a
sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-&nbsp;21&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>They have also their forts. And at a distance of fifteen feet
from this town wall they made pits as deep as the height of
three men, one over the other, and put into them (but not
above ground) lances of hard wood, with points like that of a
needle; and they covered these pits with straw and small
gravel, strewing a little earth and grass between, to the intent
that when we Christians pursued them, or assaulted their
town, we should have fallen blindly into these pitfalls. But
at length they digged so many pits that they themselves fell
into them.</p>

<p>For when our chief captain Johann Eijollas<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> commanded
all our people, except sixty men who were left in the Parchkadienes<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
to guard them, and marched them in good order
against their town Lambere, the Carios descried our approach
at a gunshot distance, and they numbered forty thousand
men armed with bows and arquebuses, and they begged
us to go back to our Parchkadienes; if we did so, they would
provide us with victuals and other necessaries, but if not
they would act as our enemies. But it did not suit us nor
our chief captain to do this, for the country and the people
pleased us very well, as did also their food, for we had not
seen nor eaten better bread during the last four years,
fish and meat having been our only sustenance.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89_89" id="Footnote_89_89" href="#FNanchor_89_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> Juan de Ayolas.</p>

</div>

<p>So the Carios took their bows and guns and received us
therewith, and told us that we were welcome, but we refused
to do them any harm. On the contrary, we told them for the
third time to keep the peace, and that we wished to be their
friends. But they did not take any notice of our words,
because they had not yet tried our bows and guns. And when
we came near them we fired at them, so that they heard it,
and saw their people fall to the ground, although they saw
not any bullet or arrow or aught else but a hole in their
body; and they wondered and were frightened, and soon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-&nbsp;22&nbsp;-</a></span>
took to flight, and fell one upon another like dogs. So they
hastened to shelter themselves in their town, after two hundred
of them had fallen into the above-mentioned pits.</p>

<p>Afterwards we Christians came to their town and assaulted
it, but they resisted as well as they could for three days.
Not being able to hold out any longer, and fearing besides
for their wives and children whom they had with them in
the town, they prayed for mercy, promising that they would
do anything for us if only we would spare their lives. Also
they gave to our commander, Johann Eijollas, six women,
the eldest of whom was only eighteen years old.</p>

<p>They also gave him six deer and other wild beasts, and besought
us to remain with them, and they gave to every soldier
two women to wait on him, and to wash and cook for him.
Besides which they gave us food and all the necessaries of
life; so that peace was then concluded between us and our
enemies.</p>

<p>After that the Carios were compelled to build us a great
house of stone, earth, and wood, in order that if in the meanwhile
they were to revolt against us we Christians might
have a place of refuge in which to defend ourselves.</p>

<p>We took this town on the feast of the Assumption, in the
year 1539, and therefore it is called Noster Signora desumsion.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

mistaken. Lambar&eacute;, with its population, was taken by Juan de
Ayolas on the 15th of August 1536. Asuncion was founded in the
following year by Juan de Salazar.</p>
</div>

<p>In this skirmish sixteen men fell on our side, and we abode
there two months. These Carios are distant from the
Aygais<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> thirty miles, and from the island Bone Speranso, <i>i.e.</i>,

<p>And so we made a covenant with the Carios, they agreeing
and promising to make war along with us, and to aid us
with eight thousand men against the Aygais.</p>

<p>After our chief captain had decided all this, he took three
hundred Spaniards and these Carios, and went down the
river, and afterwards by land for thirty miles, to a place
where the aforesaid Aygais live, of whom and of their treatment
of us we have spoken.</p>

<p>We found them at the same place where we had left them,
and we fell upon them by surprise in their houses while
they were asleep, between three and four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, for the Carios had sought them out and watched
them, and we killed everybody, young and old, for it is the
custom of the Carios, when they make war and are victorious,
to kill all without any mercy or pity whatsoever.</p>

<p>We took also more than five hundred canoes or skiffs,
and we burnt down all the villages we found, and wrought
very much damage besides. Four months afterwards, some
Aygais<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, who had not taken part in this skirmish, because
they were not then at home, came and asked for mercy, and
our commander was obliged to grant it them by order of
H. I. Majesty, who gave orders to pardon every Indian up to
the third time, but if one of them brake the peace for the
third time he should become a prisoner for life or a slave.</p>

<p>After that we continued for six months in this town,
Noster Signora Desumsion, in German &ldquo;Unser Frawen Himmelfahrt&rdquo;,
and had a good rest.</p>

<p>Then our commander Johann Eijollas<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> inquired of the
Carios about a people called Peijembas,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and they answered:
it was from this town Desumsion to the Peijembas<a name="FNanchor_97_97_2" id="FNanchor_97_97_2" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> one
hundred miles distance up the river Parabol.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Our commander then asked the Carios how the Peijembas<a name="FNanchor_97_97_3" id="FNanchor_97_97_3" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-&nbsp;24&nbsp;-</a></span>
lived, and what provisions they had, and from what they
abstained; also what kind of people they were, and of their
habits. Their answer was, that the Peijembas<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> had nothing
else but fish and meat, and also St. John&rsquo;s bread and fenugreek.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
From this fenugreek they make flour which they
eat with their fish; they also make wine of it, and this wine
is as sweet as mead in Germany.</p>

</div>

<p>Our chief captain Johann Eijollas having heard all this
from the Carios, ordered them to load five ships with provisions
of Turkish corn and other things which were in the
country; this had to be done in two months&rsquo; time, and by that
time he and his men would also equip themselves, and in the
first place go to the Peijembas,<a name="FNanchor_99_99_2" id="FNanchor_99_99_2" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and afterwards to a people
called Carch Karaisch, and the Carios promised to be always
obedient, and to fulfil in all particulars the captain&rsquo;s
orders.</p>

<p>All things having now been arranged, and the ships provided
with victual, our commander ordered all the people to
assemble, and out of the four hundred men, took three
hundred well armed; and the remaining one hundred were
left in the aforesaid town Vardellesse,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> <i>i.e.</i> Noster Signora
Desumsion, where the said Carios live. And then we went
up the river and found at a distance of five miles from these
Carios a village on the river Paraboe. The people here
brought to us Christians, victual, in the shape of fish, meat,
hens, geese, Indian sheep, and ostriches.</p>

</div>

<p>Coming at last near a village of the Carios, which is called
Weybingen,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and is at a distance of eighty miles from Noster
Signora Desumsion, we took from them victual and other
things which we could obtain from them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102" href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> There is no village of that name in Paraguai.</p>
</div>

<p>From there we came to a mountain called S. Fernando,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-&nbsp;25&nbsp;-</a></span>
which resembles the Bagenberg; there we found the said
Peijembas, who are at twelve miles distance from Weybingen,
and they met us peaceably, and received us with false hearts,
as we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>They took us into their houses and gave us fish and meat
and also fenugreek, and so we abode there for nine days.</p>

<p>Then our commander sent to ask their chief if they knew
a folk named Carchkareisso.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He replied that they knew
nothing indeed of such a people but what they had heard of
them by report, and that they dwelt far away in the country,
and that they had much gold and silver, but that they (the
Peijembas) had never seen any of them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103" href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> Guaycur&uacute;s.</p>
</div>

<p>They also told us that these Carchkareisso<a name="FNanchor_103_103_2" id="FNanchor_103_103_2" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> were wise men,
like as we Christians are, and that they had plenty of
victuals, such as Turkish corn, manioc, manduis, padades,
wachekew, mandeochparp&uuml;, mandeochade, mandepare,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> etc.,
and several other roots, the flesh of Indian sheep called
amne,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> an animal resembling a donkey, but that it has feet
like kine and a thick and coarse skin, and that they had
plenty also of deer, rabbits, geese, and hens; but that none
of the Peijembas<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> as has been said, had ever seen all this,
but only knew it by report of others. But we found afterwards
how things were situated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104" href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> Manduvis, potatoes, papas, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Having learned all this, our chief commander required to
have some Peijembas to go with him into that country, whereupon
they readily offered themselves, and presently their
chief appointed three hundred Peijembas to accompany us
to carry our victual and other necessaries. Our commander
ordered these people to prepare themselves, for he would be
starting in four days, and of the five ships he ordered three
to sail, and on the other two he left fifty men of us
Christians, whom he ordered to wait there during his five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-&nbsp;26&nbsp;-</a></span>
months&rsquo; absence, and that if within that space of time he
returned not unto us, that we should go back with these two
vessels to Noster Signora Desumsion. But it so happened
that we abode among these Peijembas for six months, and
never heard anything in the meanwhile of our commander
Johann Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and we grew short of victual, so that we
were compelled to return with our temporary commander
Martin Domingo Eijolla<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> to the town Signora, according to
the orders of our chief commander.</p>

</div>

<p>How our chief commander Johann Eijollas made his
voyage shall be presently recorded.</p>

<p>First, when he departed from the Peijembas,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> he came to a
folk named Naperus,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> who are on friendly terms with the
Peijembas; they have nothing but fish and flesh, and are a
people of considerable numbers. Our commander took with
him some of these Naperus to show him the way, for they
were to pass through divers countries, and many nations,
with great difficulty and penury of all things, and meet with
much resistance; so much so that nearly one-half of the
Christians died during this voyage. Finally, when he had
come to a people called the Peijssennas,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> he could not go any
further, but was compelled to turn back again with all his
people except three sick Spaniards, whom he left among the
Peijssennas.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109_109" id="Footnote_109_109" href="#FNanchor_109_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> This word Peiembas is not Guaran&iacute;. It must be the <i>Payagu&aacute;s</i>,
one of the tribes occupying the right bank of the river Paraguay, to
which Schmidt refers here, or perhaps the <i>Mbai&agrave;s</i>, the tribe adjacent
to them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110" href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> Yaper&uacute;s, a tribe of the Payagu&aacute;s.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111" href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> The Peyssennas are the same as the Peiembas. I believe the
author is referring to the Payagu&aacute;s.</p>
</div>

<p>Our chief commander therefore, Johann Eijollas being
<i>salvo mendo</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in good health, had come back with his men
to the Naperus, where he stayed until the third day, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-&nbsp;27&nbsp;-</a></span>
the men were faint and overtired with the journey, and
because they had no further supplies.</p>

<p>But the Naperus, understanding this, resolved with the
Peijembas, and made an agreement with them to the effect,
that they would kill and make away with the chief commander
Johann Eijollas and all his men, and they did so
afterwards, for when Johann Eijollas was going with his
Christians from the Naperus to the Peijembas, and had gone
about half-way, they were attacked unawares, and with loud
cries by the Naperus and their allies the Peijembas, who fell
upon them like mad dogs, as they were passing through a
forest; and they were mercilessly and miserably slaughtered,
sick and faint Christians as they were, including their commander
Johann Eijollas,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> so that not one of them escaped.
God have mercy on their souls!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112" href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> Juan de Ayolas.</p>
</div>

<p>Now as we fifty men had gone to the town Noster Signora
Desumsion, and were waiting there for our commander
Johann Eijollas and our soldiers, to know how things had
gone, we heard tidings from an Indian who had been a slave
to the late Johann Eijollas, and had been brought by him
from the Peijssennas, and who had escaped because of his
knowledge of the language. But although this man told us
minutely all that had happened from beginning to end, we
would not believe him.</p>

<p>And having remained during a whole year in the above-named
town, Noster Signora, we were unable to gather any
certain information as to how it had fared with our soldiers;
only the Carios told our commander Martin Domingo Eijolla<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
that the general report was, that our Christians had all
perished at the hands of the Peijembas.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But we would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-&nbsp;28&nbsp;-</a></span>
yet believe it until we should hear from a Peijemba himself
that it was true. After two months the Carios brought to
our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, two Peijembas
whom they had taken captive. These Peijembas being asked
if they had really slain them all, denied it most emphatically,
and said that our chief commander and his men were not
yet gone away from their land.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_113_113" id="Footnote_113_113" href="#FNanchor_113_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_114_114" id="Footnote_114_114" href="#FNanchor_114_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> Payagu&aacute;s. These were the Indians who killed Juan de Ayolas
and all his people, according to Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca in his
<i>Comentarios</i>, <i>infra</i>, and Ruy Diaz de Guzman in <i>La Argentina</i>;
also Herrera, <i>D&eacute;cada</i>, v, libro 7, capitulo 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Our commander then obtained permission from the judge
and the provost-marshal that the two prisoners should be
put to the torture in order that they might tell the truth;
and by his order they were tormented in such a manner that
they were compelled to confess that they had killed the
Christians and their chief.</p>

<p>In consequence thereof our commander Martin Domingo
Eijolla had them judged, and ordered the two Peijembas to
be tied to a tree around which a great fire was made in order
to burn them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it seemed good to us Christians to elect Martin
Domingo Eijolla for our chief commander (especially because
he had behaved so well against the war-people), until
H. I. Majesty should give further orders.</p>

<p>Then Martin Eijolla ordered to prepare four parchkadienes,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
and taking one hundred and fifty soldiers, the
others being left in the aforesaid town of Noster Signora, he
gave us to understand that he would gather together
the other people who had been left among the Peijembas
for reasons before mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and the one hundred and sixty
Spaniards left at Bonas Aeieres<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> in the two ships, and bring
them to the town Noster Signora Desumsion. Then he,
Martin Domingo Eijolla, departed with these four brigantines
down the rivers Parabol and Paranon.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-&nbsp;29&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Now before we came to the Thijembas,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> it was resolved by
the Christians who waited there for us, namely, by a captain
named Franciscus Ruis, and Johann Paban, a priest, and a
secretary named Johann Ernandus,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> governors of the
Christians, that they would kill the chief of the Thijembus,
and certain other Indians, and they verily performed this
impious and mischievous deed, and put from life to death
the Indians who had rendered them for so long a time so
many services before we came down there with Martin
Domingo Eijolla.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119" href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> Timbus.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_120_120" id="Footnote_120_120" href="#FNanchor_120_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> These names are Francisco Ruiz Galan, Juan Pavon and Juan
Hernandez; Juan Pavon was not a clergyman, but an alcalde.</p>
</div>

<p>And when we arrived at these Thijembus and Christians,
our commander was alarmed at this murder and at the flight
of the Thijembus.<a name="FNanchor_119_119_2" id="FNanchor_119_119_2" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> But he could do nothing, and therefore he
left victuals in the castle of Corpus Christi, also our twenty
men, with a commander named Antonius Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and
gave strict orders that he should not trust the Indians in any
way, but that he should keep strict watch by day and by night,
and if it happened that the Indians should come back and
be friendly with him, that he should deal courteously with
them, and give them all tokens of friendship, yet to be on
his guard and beware lest any misfortune should happen to
them or to other Christians.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121" href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> Antonio de Mendoza.</p>
</div>

<p>Now our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> took down
with him those three persons who were the authors of the
manslaughter, namely Francisco Ruis, the priest Johann
Paban, and Ernandus, the secretary. And when they were
about to take their journey and depart from us, a chief
of the Thijembus, named Zeicho Lijemii,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> came; this one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-&nbsp;30&nbsp;-</a></span>
the Christians&rsquo; friend, who showed good-will towards them,
but from a false and treacherous heart (as will be seen hereafter)
said falsely that he must pretend to be on good terms
with the Indians, for the sake of wife, children, and friends.
And he engaged with our commander to take all the
Christians with him down the river, because the whole
country was up in arms against them to kill them or drive
them out. To whom our chief commander, Martin Domingo
Eijolla answered, that he would soon be back, that his
people were strong enough to resist the Indians, and added,
that he, Zeiche Lijemii should come over to the Christians,
with wife, children, and friends, and with all his folk; and
Zeiche Lijemii replied that he would do so.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_122_122" id="Footnote_122_122" href="#FNanchor_122_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>

part of the author.</p>
</div>

<p>Then our chief commander sailed down the river, leaving
us at Corpus Christi. About eight days afterwards, the
aforesaid Indian Zeicho Lijemii sent one of his brothers,
named Suelapa,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> treacherously, and requested our commander,
Antonius Manchossa, to place at his disposal six Christians
armed with guns and other weapons, for he wished to bring
his household with his family to us, and henceforth live
among us, and he remarked withal that he feared the
Thijembus, and that without such help, he could scarcely hope
to bring his things out in safety. He showed himself in
such a way as though he would bring us victual and all sorts
of necessaries, but that was all knavery and deception.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_124_124" id="Footnote_124_124" href="#FNanchor_124_124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> Not a Guaran&iacute; name.</p>
</div>

<p>Our commander not only promised him six men, but gave
him fifty well armed Spaniards, and ordered these fifty men
to be watchful and on their guard, in order that they might
not suffer any harm at the hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>It was not more than half a mile distance from us
Christians to these Thijembus, and when our fifty men came
to their settlement, the Thijembus came out to them, and gave
them a Judas kiss, and brought them fish and meat to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-&nbsp;31&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Now when the Christians began to fall to their meat,
these Thijembus, with their allies who were hidden in the
houses and in the fields, suddenly fell upon them, and so
consecrated the banquet with them, that not a man of them
escaped alive, but one lad called Kalderon.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> God be merciful
to them and to us all. Amen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125" href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> Calderon.</p>
</div>

<p>Afterwards they set upon us with ten thousand men or
more, and besieged us, and thought they would vanquish us,
but that did not happen, God be praised! although they
stayed fourteen days before our place, and attacked us day
and night.</p>

<p>They had this time long spears or javelins, which they
had learnt how to make from the Christians, with which
they drave at us and defended themselves.</p>

<p>And it happened on that same day that the Indians attacked
us by night with all their force, and burnt down our
houses, that our commander, Antonius Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> armed
with a two-handed sword ran out of a gate near which some
Indians lay in ambush so that they could not be seen; and
the Indians thrust him through with their spears, so that he
presently fell down dead without uttering a word. God&rsquo;s
mercy be with him! Now the Indians could not remain any
longer because they had nothing to eat, so they broke up
half their camp and departed.</p>

</div>

<p>After this two brigantines laden with provisions and other
necessaries came to us from Bonas Aeieres<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> sent by our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> in order that we might
maintain ourselves where we were until the said commander&rsquo;s
arrival, which cheered us very much indeed. But those who
came with the two ships were very sorrowful for the Christians
that were slain. We therefore determined by a common
council, and found it best to abide no longer in the village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-&nbsp;32&nbsp;-</a></span>
Corpus Christi near these Thijembus, but we went all of us
down the river and came to Bonas Aeieres to our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla. He was much shocked and very
angry about the slaughter of the people, and doubtful how
to consult what he should first do, seeing that victual and
other necessary things failed us.</p>

<p>But after we had stayed for five days at Bonas Aeieres, a
ship called a <i>Carabelle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> came from Spain, and brought us
fresh tidings to wit, that a ship had arrived at St. Catharina,
whose captain was called Albernunzo Gabrero,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and he had
brought with him two hundred soldiers from Spain.</p>

<p>As soon as our commander had heard these tidings, he
ordered one of the two lesser ships, which was called a

to <a id="Catharina"></a>Sta. Catharina in Priesiell,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> which is thirty miles<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> from
Bonas Aeieres, and appointed for it a commander named
Conssaillo Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> to govern the ship, and he charged
him, when he arrived with his ship at St. Catherina in
Priesiell, to load her with provisions, namely rice, manioc,
and other things as he should think fit.</p>

miles. Santa Catalina did not then belong to Brazil, but to the Gobernacion
del Rio de la Plata (Government of the River Plate), belonging
to the Spanish Crown. Schmidt could not have been ignorant of
this, since he had been there with the expedition of Don Pedro de
Mendoza.</p>

</div>

<p>This commander, Conssaillo Manchossa, asked Martin
Domingo Eijolla for six trusty soldiers, whom he could rely
upon; and they were promised him. So he took me and six
Spaniards, and also twenty more soldiers and seamen.</p>

<p>Departing from Bonas Aeieres, we came in a month&rsquo;s
time to St. Catharina, and finding the above-mentioned ship
which had arrived from Spain, and the commander, Albernunzo
Gabrero, with all his men, we were greatly rejoiced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-&nbsp;33&nbsp;-</a></span>
and stayed there for two months, loading our ship with
rice, manioc, and Turkish corn, so full that we could not take
any more.</p>

<p>Then having sailed with both ships and the commander,
Albernunzo Gabrero, and all his people from S. Catharina
towards Bonas Aeieres in India, we arrived at twenty miles
from the river Paranaw Wassu.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This river is forty miles
wide at its mouth, and has the same width for eighty miles,
until one reaches a harbour called S. Gabriel, where the river
(Parana) has a width of eight miles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_134_134" id="Footnote_134_134" href="#FNanchor_134_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> In early times this river was called Rio de Solis, and afterwards
also Paran&aacute; Guaz&uacute;. Its mouth, as we have before stated (<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>),
is 188 miles wide between Capes Santa Maria and San Antonio. The
width of the Paran&aacute; proper, where it empties into the Plate, at the
end of the Delta, is twenty-five miles, between the island of Martin
Garcia and Point San Fernando.</p>
</div>

<p>Having arrived as before said, to within twenty miles of
this river, on All Saints&rsquo; eve, the two ships approached at
night close to one another, and the one spoke the other, asking
if we were in the river Paranaw; our seaman said we
were in that river, but the other one said we were at a
distance of twenty miles from it.</p>

<p>For when two, three, or more ships sail in company, they
always come together at sunset, and ask one another how
long they have sailed day and night, and what wind they
intend taking at night, in order that they may not separate
from one another.</p>

<p>After this our skipper again addressed the master of the
other ship, asking if he would follow him, but the other said
that it was already night, and he would therefore stand out
to sea till next morning, and would not make the land by
night; this skipper was indeed somewhat wiser than ours
as the event afterwards proved.</p>

<p>While our ship continued on its way that night, having
parted company with the other, great storm-winds arose at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-&nbsp;34&nbsp;-</a></span>
sea, so that we saw the land by twelve or one o&rsquo;clock, before
we could anchor.</p>

<p>And when the ship had touched the ground, we having
notwithstanding a full mile to make in order to reach
land, knew of no other counsel save to appeal to God
Almighty that He might be merciful and take pity on us.
That same hour our ship was broken into many thousand
pieces, and fifteen of our men and six Indians were drowned.
Some taking hold of large pieces of timber swam out, and I
with five of my companions escaped on the mast. But of
the fifteen drowned we could not find one. God bless them
and us all. Amen.</p>

<p>We had afterwards to go on foot one hundred miles,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> having
lost all our clothes and victual, and had to sustain ourselves
with such roots and fruits as we could find in the
fields, until we came to the haven called S. Gabriel, where
we found the aforesaid ship with her captain, which had
arrived there thirty days before us.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_135_135" id="Footnote_135_135" href="#FNanchor_135_135"><span class="label">[135]</span></a> The distance which Schmidt and his companions would have had
to walk, in a straight line between Cape Santa Maria, where it is probable
that the shipwreck took place, and the island of San Gabriel,
would have been 255 English miles.</p>
</div>

<p>When this mishap had been reported to our commander,
Martino Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> he and all his men were very
sorry, for they thought we had all perished, and they had
already caused masses to be said for our souls.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as we had arrived at Bonas Aeieres,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla, ordered the captain of our
ship and the pilot to come before him; and if there had not
been much intercession on behalf of the pilot he would have
been hanged. He was, however, condemned to stay for four
years on the bergentin ships.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_137_137" id="Footnote_137_137" href="#FNanchor_137_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> Buenos Ayres.</p>
</div>

<p>All the people being together at Bonas Aeieres, our chief
captain ordered that the bergentin ships should be made ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-&nbsp;35&nbsp;-</a></span>
and that all the soldiers should be in them together, and that
they should burn the great ships; preserving, however, the
iron tackling. After this had been done, we sailed once
more up the river Paranaw, and came to the town Noster
Signora Desumsion, where we remained two years, waiting
further orders from H. I. Majesty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another chief commander named Albernunzo
Cabessa de Bacha,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> came from Spain, appointed by H. I.
Majesty, with four hundred men and thirty horses, in four
vessels, two of which were large ships, and the other two
Karabella.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> These four ships arrived in Brazil at the haven
called Wiessay, or S. Catherina,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> to seek provision of victual,
and when the commander had sent the two Karabella to sail
eight miles distance from that port to seek for victuals, such
a storm befell them that they were both compelled to remain
at sea, and they perished, being broken all to pieces, but
the men escaped.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> When the chief captain heard of this,
he durst not put to sea with the other two ships; but,
since they were unseaworthy, he had them broken up, and
came to us in haste by land to Riodellaplata, to the town
Noster Signora desumsion, on the river Paraboe, and brought
not more than three hundred out of the four hundred men
with him, the remainder having died of hunger and disease.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

which is perfectly correct.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_141_141" id="Footnote_141_141" href="#FNanchor_141_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> Cabeza de Vaca does not say that the two ships were wrecked, but
that they had to put back to S. Catherina on account of bad weather.
Cf. his <i>Comentarios</i>, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_142_142" id="Footnote_142_142" href="#FNanchor_142_142"><span class="label">[142]</span></a> When the Emperor was made acquainted of Don Pedro de Mendoza&rsquo;s
death, he appointed another Adelantado to take his place, in
case the Lieutenant-Governor whom Mendoza had left there had died
too. The new Adelantado was Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, famous
for his shipwrecks and adventures in Florida. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez sailed
from Spain in November 1540. He brought with him orders to take
possession of the sea-coast belonging to Spain, south of the Portuguese
Capitania de San Vicente. He first took possession of the ports of
Cananea, San Francisco, and Santa Catalina, all pertaining to Spain.
This island was given to the Adelantado as a personal gift for the term
of twelve years, on condition of maintaining its possession and keeping
there the Indians who inhabited it. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez stopped there
several months. In May 1541 he sent out some of his people to Buenos
Ayres in one of his ships; but storms forced them to return to the
island. The wrecks mentioned by Schmidt did not occur. Towards
the end of the same year, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez with half his people and twenty-six
horses started by land for Asuncion, and he gave the name of Province
of Vera to the territory of Guaira (now the Brazilian Province
of Paran&aacute;), which belonged to his Gobernacion. He marched across
the province, taking possession of it on behalf of Spain, and arrived
at Asuncion on the 11th of March 1542, after a painful journey of
four months and a half. The other half of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez&rsquo;s people,
under the command of his nephew, Pedro Estopi&ntilde;an, went by sea to
Buenos Ayres, and found the town of Don Pedro de Mendoza abandoned
and the houses burnt by order of the ambitious Irala.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-&nbsp;36&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>This Commander was eight whole months on his way,
for the distance is reckoned to be five hundred miles from
Noster Signora desumsion to this place or harbour of S.
Catherina.</p>

<p>He also brought with him from Spain his commission
from H. I. Majesty, and required that Martin Domingo
Eijolla<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> should yield up the whole government to him, and
that all the men should be obedient to him in every respect.
The commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, and all the people
declared they were ready to obey, but with this understanding,
that he, Cabessa de Bacha, should show and lay
before them some document to prove that he had received
from His Imperial Majesty such powers and authority.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_143_143" id="Footnote_143_143" href="#FNanchor_143_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>
</div>

<p>But this the whole assembly could not obtain from him;
only the priests and two or three of the captains affirmed it,
that Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha ruled and commanded;
but we shall see hereafter how things went with him.</p>

<p>Now, this said Albernunzo Cabessa passed all the people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-&nbsp;37&nbsp;-</a></span>
review, and found that there were eight hundred men. At
the same time he made friendship with Martino Domingo
Eijolla, and they became sworn brothers, so that he, Martino
Domingo Eijolla, no less than before commanded the people.</p>

<p>After this review he, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,
ordered nine Bergentines to be prepared, that he might sail
up the river Paraboe as far as he could. But at the same
time, and before the ships were made ready, he sent out three
Bergentines with one hundred and fifteen soldiers, to go as
far as they could, in order to find Indians who had manioc
and Turkish corn. He appointed them two captains, named
Anthonius Gabrero and Diego Tabellino. They came first to
a people called Surukufers,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who had Turkish corn, manioc,
and other roots, such as mandues, which resemble hazel-nuts,
and also fish and meat.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144" href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> Samacosis, says the Spanish translator, in Barcia&rsquo;s Collection. But
the Indians in those parts were the Itatis and Guaycur&uacute;s, generally
known as the Cheriguanos. (Cf. <i>infra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>.)</p>
</div>

<p>The men wear in their lips a great blue stone, like a
draughtsman, and the women have their privities covered.</p>

<p>Among these people we left our ships, and with them
some of our companions to guard them, and went thence into
the country. After four days&rsquo; journey we came to a village,
occupied by the Carios, who were about three thousand men
strong, of whom we inquired diligently of the state of that
country, and we received honest and peaceable answers from
them. Returning thence, we again came back to our ships,
and going down the river of Paraboe, we came to a nation
called the Achkeres. Here we found a letter from our chief
captain, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, to the effect that we
should hang the chief of these Indians, named Achkere.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
Our commander at once complied with this order, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-&nbsp;38&nbsp;-</a></span>
which afterwards a great war broke out, as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_145_145" id="Footnote_145_145" href="#FNanchor_145_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> Aracar&eacute;, according to Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, in the
<i>Comentarios</i>, by Pero Hernandez, secretary to the Adelantado, Valladolid,
1555. (See <i>infra</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>Now, when this had happened, to wit, that the above-mentioned
Indian had come by his death in this way, we
returned down the river to Noster Signora desumsion, and
told our commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, what we
had done and seen during this voyage. Then he asked the
chief Indian who was in the town Noster Signora,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that he
should appoint him two thousand Indians who should go
with us up the river.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_146_146" id="Footnote_146_146" href="#FNanchor_146_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> La Asuncion.</p>
</div>

<p>The Indians promised to be willing and obedient, and
added that our commander should first of all think well
about it before going into that country,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> because the whole
of it belonged to Dabere,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> a chief of the Carios, who was
prepared to come out in full force against the Christians.
For this Dabere, they said, was Achkere&rsquo;s brother, whom the
Christians hanged, and therefore he intended to avenge his
brother&rsquo;s death. So our commander had to refrain from this
voyage, and prepare himself to go to war against his enemies.
He then ordered his sworn brother, Martino Domingo
Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> to take four hundred Christians and two thousand
Indians, and go against this Dabere and the Carios, and
either drive them out of the whole country or utterly destroy
them. The said Eijolla faithfully followed this mandate,
and went with these people out of the city Noster Signora,
and advanced towards the enemy, having first warned them
on behalf of H. I. Majesty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>But this Dabere, little regarding the warning, would
admit no treaty of peace; for he had gathered a considerable
number of people together, and his settlements were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-&nbsp;39&nbsp;-</a></span>
strongly fenced with palisadoes, which means wooden walls<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>;
and compassed about with three such walls and many wide
pits whereof we have already spoken; but we had found all
this out before. So we stood still quietly with our army till
the fourth day before we proclaimed war against them; the
fourth day in the morning, three hours before daybreak, we
fell upon the place, slaying all that we found there, and we
captured many women, preserving them from slaughter,
which was a great help to us afterwards.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_150_150" id="Footnote_150_150" href="#FNanchor_150_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> <i>I.e.</i>, stockades.</p>
</div>

<p>In this assault sixteen Christians were slain, and many of
us wounded and hurt. Also many of our Indians perished;
but they did not gain very much from us, for on their side
more than three thousand were slain.</p>

<p>Not very long after Dabere came with his people to ask
for mercy, and that we should give him back his wives and
children; then he and his people would serve the Christians
and obey them. Our commander was compelled by H. I.
Majesty to grant them that.</p>

<p>After this peace had been concluded, we again went down
the river Paraboe<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> to our chief commander, Albernunzo
Cabessa de Bacha,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and we told him how all had happened.</p>

</div>

<p>Then he thought of making his intended voyage, and he
asked of Dabere, who was now satisfied, two thousand
armed Indians to go with him; and they were willing, and
promised to be always obedient. He also commanded the
Carios to load the nine little Bergentin ships.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> All this
being done, he took five hundred Christians out of the eight
hundred, and he left the remaining three hundred in the
town Noster Signora desumsion, and appointed as their
commander Johann Salleisser.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>He then sailed up the river Paraboe with this army of
five hundred Christians and two thousand Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-&nbsp;40&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The Carios had eighty-three canoes, and we Christians had
nine Bergentin ships, in every one of which there were two
horses; but the horses were conveyed overland one hundred
miles, and we went by water unto a mountain called S. Fernando,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
where the horses were shipped, and then we came to
our enemies, the Peijembus,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> but they did not wait for us, but
soon fled away with their wives and children, having first
burnt down their houses. After this we travelled together
for one hundred miles, and found no people all that way, till
at length we came to a nation named the Bachereos,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> who
live on fish and meat. It is a numerous people, who inhabit
a large country over one hundred miles in extent, and they
have also many canoes. Their women have their privities
covered. They would not speak with us, but fled away from
us. Afterwards we came to another people called Surukusis,
where the three aforesaid ships were.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> They were at ninety
miles distance from the Baschereos, and they received us in a
friendly way; each of them has his own lodging, with his
wife and children; the men have a rounded piece of wood like
draughts, hanging at the end of their ears. The women
wear a grey stone of crystal, thick and long as a finger, in
their lips; they are nice-looking, and go about quite naked.
They have also plenty of Turkish corn, manioc, manduis,
padades, etc., fish and meat in abundance; it is a great people.</p>

<p>Our commander asked them about a people named Carchkareos,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and also about the Carios. They could not give
information about the Carchkareos, but they said that the
Carios were with them in their houses; but it was not true.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_159_159" id="Footnote_159_159" href="#FNanchor_159_159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> Charcas.</p>
</div>

<p>Having learned this, our commander ordered us to prepare
ourselves in order to go further into the country. He appointed
one hundred and fifty men to stay with the ships, to
whom he gave provision for two years. And he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-&nbsp;41&nbsp;-</a></span>
three hundred and fifty Christians and the eighteen horses,
and the two thousand Indians or Carios who went out with
us from Noster Signora desumsion, and marched into the
country; but he did not do much, because he was not the
right sort of man. Besides, all the officers and soldiers hated
him for his perverse and rigorous carriage towards the men.
We travelled eighteen days&rsquo; journey without seeing either
Carios or any other people; and food also failing us, our
commander was again obliged to return with us to the ships.
And when we turned back he sent out a Spaniard, named
Franciscus Riefere,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> with ten other armed Spaniards, and
ordered them to go forward ten days&rsquo; journey, and if in that
time they should not find any other people, they should
return to us to the ships, where we would wait for them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_160_160" id="Footnote_160_160" href="#FNanchor_160_160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> Francisco de Ribera.</p>
</div>

<p>It happened that they found a populous nation of Indians,
who had plenty of Turkish corn, manioc, and other roots.
But the Spaniards durst not show themselves, but returned
to us, and told it to our chief captain. He was very desirous
to have gone into that country, but was hindered by waters<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
that he could not proceed. He therefore ordered a ship to
be furnished, wherein he put eighty men, and gave us
Ernando Rieffere<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> for our captain, and sent us up the river
Paraboe to discover the nation named Scherues,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and ordered
that we should go two days&rsquo; journey into the interior of the
country and no farther, and then report to him of that land
and its inhabitants.</p>

</div>

<p>So departing, on the first day we came on the other side of
the country to a people named Surukusis, who live in an
island<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> which is thirty miles wide, and encompassed by the
river Paraboe; they eat manioc, maize, manduis, padades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-&nbsp;42&nbsp;-</a></span>
mandepore, parpii, Bachkeku, and other roots; also fish and
meat. The men and women are like the above-mentioned
Surukusis in face and figure. We remained one day among
them, and the second day we set off again. Ten canoes of
these Indians accompanied us and showed us our way, and
twice a day they hunted wild beasts and fished to supply us
with food. After six days&rsquo; journey we came to a people called
Achkeres. They are very numerous, men and women, are
big and tall, the like whereof were not to be seen in the
whole Riodellaplata. These Achkeres are three miles
distance from the aforesaid Surukusis; they have nothing to
eat but fish and meat; the women have their privities
covered. Among these Achkeres<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> we remained one day,
and then the above-mentioned Surukusis returned with their
ten canoes to their village. Afterwards our commander,
Ernando Riefere<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> asked the Achkeres to show us the way
to the Scherues, and they were willing to do so, and came
with eight canoes out of their place with us, and twice every
day fished and hunted, so that we should have plenty to eat.
The reason why they are called Achkeres, is as follows.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_164_164" id="Footnote_164_164" href="#FNanchor_164_164"><span class="label">[164]</span></a> This island was called Isla del Paraiso (Paradise Island) by the
Spaniards. The Indians living there were the Itatis.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_165_165" id="Footnote_165_165" href="#FNanchor_165_165"><span class="label">[165]</span></a> <i>Yacar&eacute;</i> is the name, in the Guaran&iacute; language, of the amphibious
animals similar to the crocodile, to which Schmidt alludes hereafter.
But there never was a tribe of that name; perhaps it was the name of
a cacique.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_166_166" id="Footnote_166_166" href="#FNanchor_166_166"><span class="label">[166]</span></a> Hernando de Ribera.</p>
</div>

<p>Achkarus is a fish which has a hard skin all over, so that
it cannot be wounded with a knife, nor can one shoot it with
an Indian dart. It is a big fish, which does great harm to
other fishes. Its eggs, which it lays at about two or three
paces from the water&rsquo;s edge, have the taste of musk and are
good for eating; the tail is the best part, though the whole
fish is harmless; it lives always in the water. In our
Germany that fish is reckoned to be noxious and even
venomous, and is called a crocodile. And it is said, that if
one looks at that fish, and even more, if the fish breathes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-&nbsp;43&nbsp;-</a></span>
upon any one, that person must by all means die; which is
not according to truth, for man must also die without that,
and nothing is more certain.</p>

<p>Further it is said that if such a fish is found in a well,
there is no other means to kill it than to show it a mirror,
in order that it may look at itself therein; it must then die
from the sight of its own atrocious face.</p>

<p>But all these sayings are fables, and nothing else, for I
should have died a hundred times if it had been true, having
caught and eaten over three thousand of these fishes myself,
and I would not have written so much about this fish if I
had not had such good reason for it.</p>

<p>The ninth day after our departure we came to the Scherues,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
who are reckoned to be thirty-six miles distant from the
Achkeres. This nation is very populous, but these were not
the genuine people among whom the king lives. These
Scherues to whom we now came wear a moustache, and have
a wooden ring in the tips of their ears, and the ear is folded
round the wooden ring in a wonderful manner. The men
have also a large blue crystal in their lips of the shape and
size of a draughtsman. And they are painted blue on their
bodies from the head to the knees so as to give them the
appearance of wearing breeches.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_167_167" id="Footnote_167_167" href="#FNanchor_167_167"><span class="label">[167]</span></a> Xarayos. These and the Itatis were the Indians living near the
island of Paraiso, on the left bank of the river Paraguai. According
to the best authorities the right name for this tribe is <a id="Guarayos"></a><i>Guarayos</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>But the women are painted otherwise, blue from the breast
to the privities, and so artistically, that one could not soon
find a painter to do it so well. They are absolutely naked,
and are beautiful after their manner, and also commit transgressions
in the dark.</p>

<p>Among these Scherues we remained one day, and afterwards
in three days&rsquo; journey we came to a king, who lives at
fourteen miles distance, and whose people are also called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-&nbsp;44&nbsp;-</a></span>
Scherues. His country is only four miles wide, but he has
also a settlement on the river Paraboe.</p>

<p>There we left our ship with twelve Spaniards to watch it,
that we might use it for our defence on our return. We also
ordered these Scherues dwelling there to hold friendly intercourse
with the Christians, which they also did.</p>

<p>We remained thus two days in this place, and prepared
ourselves for travel, and took all that was wanted and passed
over the river Paraboe,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and so came to the King who lives
there himself.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_168_168" id="Footnote_168_168" href="#FNanchor_168_168"><span class="label">[168]</span></a> Paraguai.</p>
</div>

<p>And when we were approaching near and were about one
mile off, the King of the Scherues came forth to meet us with
twelve thousand men, or even more, on a heath, yet in a
friendly and peaceable manner. The path they followed was
eight feet broad, and was covered entirely with flowers and
herbs up to their place, and made so clean that not so much as
any little stone, stick, or straw appeared. The King was also
accompanied by his musicians, whose instruments resemble
our hoboys. His Royal Majesty had also ordered that deer
and other wild beasts should be hunted on both sides of the
way; so that they caught about thirty deer and twenty
ostriches, and it was indeed an agreeable thing to see;
and when we came to their place, the King appointed a
house to accommodate every two Christians, and our captain
with his servants were taken into the Royal House, and I
was not very far from the King&rsquo;s house. Then the King of the
Scherues<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and his subjects resolved to treat us Christians
well, and to give us all our necessaries. And the King also
held a Court in his own way, like the greatest lord in
the country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_169_169" id="Footnote_169_169" href="#FNanchor_169_169"><span class="label">[169]</span></a> Xarayos.</p>
</div>

<p>At dinner the musicians must play whenever it is his
pleasure. Then the men and the most beautiful women
must dance before him, and such a dance is to us Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-&nbsp;45&nbsp;-</a></span>
quite wonderful, so much so that looking upon them one
could think of nothing else. These people are like the
Scherues, of whom we spoke before.</p>

<p>Their wives make mantles from cotton very subtle, almost
like satin, on which they embroider several figures, as deer,
ostriches, Indian sheep, or what else they can. In these
mantles they sleep when it is cold, or they sit upon them, or
use them at their pleasure. These women are very fair and
venerous, very amiable, and very hot too, as it seemed to me.</p>

<p>There we remained four days. Meanwhile, the King asked
our commander what were our wishes, and whither we
intended to go; and our commander replied he was seeking
for gold and silver. The King gave him a silver crown,
which weighed one and a half mark nearly, and a bar of gold,
a span and a half in length and half a span broad; also a
bracelet, <i>i.e.</i>, a half-harness, and many other things in silver,
and then said to our commander: He had no more gold or
silver, and that these things were the spoils which in time
past he had won in war from the Amazons.</p>

<p>And when he came to speak of the Amazons, and gave us
to understand of their great riches, we were very glad to
learn of it. And our commander presently asked the King
if we could come to them by water; and how far it was
to these Amazons.</p>

<p>The King answered we could not reach them by water, but
would have to go by land, and travel during two whole
months. Thereupon we decided to go to these Amazons,
as will be related hereafter.</p>

<p>These women, the Amazons, have only one breast, and the
men come to their wives only three or four times in the
year; and if the woman, being in child by her husband, bring
forth a male child, she sends that boy away to his father.</p>

<p>But if it be a girl, she keepeth it with her, and seareth the
right breast, in order that it may grow no more. The reason
for this is, that they may be more fit to handle their weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-&nbsp;46&nbsp;-</a></span>
and bows, for they are war-like women, making continual
war against their enemies.</p>

<p>These women inhabit an island surrounded by water, and
a large island it is too; and there is no access to it but by
canoes. But in this island the Amazons have neither gold
nor silver, though they are reported to have great riches in the
<i>terra firma</i> where the men live. It is a very great nation,
and is said to have a King whose name appears to be
Iegnis, and they told us where he lived.</p>

<p>Now, our commander, Ernando Rieffere,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> desired the said
King of the Scherues<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> to place at our disposal some of his
subjects to carry our plunder and to show us the way,
because he intended to enter the interior of the country,
and to seek out those above-mentioned Amazons. The
King was willing to do so, but he said that at this time
of the year the land would be under water, and therefore
travelling there would not do at this season. We would
not, however, believe his words, but were urgent to have
his Indians. He therefore gave our commander for his
person twenty men to carry his plunder and victual, and to
each of us he gave five Indians to serve us and carry our
necessaries, for we would have to go eight days&rsquo; journey
without finding an Indian.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170" href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> Hernando de Ribera.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_171_171" id="Footnote_171_171" href="#FNanchor_171_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> Xarayos. All that precedes about the Amazons is a ridiculous tale
which Schmidt could not have heard from any of those poor Indians,
who had not the slightest idea about the Scythian mythology or the
ancient fables from which this passage of his book is taken, after
the fashion for the wonderful, prevalent at this period. The source
of this story in the New World is the voyage made in 1540-41 by the
Spanish officer, Orellana, who was the first to navigate the great river
called <i>of the Amazons</i>, on account of his having related that he met on
its banks a tribe of women warriors.</p>
</div>

<p>Afterwards we came to a certain nation called Siberis,
who resemble the Scherues in their language and in other
respects. We advanced for eight whole days and nights in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-&nbsp;47&nbsp;-</a></span>
water up to the knees, and sometimes as high as the
waist; nor could we by any means come out of it. When
we wished to make a fire, we heaped big fagot-sticks one on
another, and made a fire thereon; and it happened several
times that as we were about to cook our meat, both the pot
in which we had our food and the fire fell into the water, and
then we had to remain without eating. We also could
not find any rest either by day or night, because of the small
flies, against which we could do nothing.</p>

<p>We therefore asked these Siberis if there were any more
water, and they said we would have to wade four more days in
the water, and afterwards would have to travel five other
days by land; and at length we should come to a people named
Orthuses,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and they gave us to understand that we were too
few in number, and therefore we had better return. But
this we would not do for the Scherues sake, for we thought
rather of sending them back to their town who were accompanying
us. But the said Scherues refused to go, because the
King had ordered them not to leave us, but to serve us until
we came again out of that country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_172_172" id="Footnote_172_172" href="#FNanchor_172_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> Urtuesses; cf. Hernando de Ribera&rsquo;s narrative, <i>infra</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The aforesaid Siberis then gave us ten men, who, together
with the Scherues, should show us the way to the aforesaid
Orthuses; so we went along for another seven days
through water up to the waist or the knee; this water
was quite as hot as if it had been heated on the fire, and
we were compelled to drink it, for want of any other water.
Some might suppose that it was a flowing water, but this was
not so, for at that time rain had fallen so heavily that the
whole land was inundated, for it is a flat land; how we
suffered from the effects of this water shall be told hereafter.</p>

<p>Thus on the ninth day, between ten and eleven before
noon, we came to the place of the Orthuses, and by midday we
arrived in the centre of the village, where the chief&rsquo;s house
stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-&nbsp;48&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>But at that very time there was a great mortality among
the Orthuses, caused by famine, for they had nothing to eat,
the locusts or grasshoppers having twice eaten and destroyed
all the corn and the fruits of their trees. When we
Christians saw this, and heard how things were going
there, we became frightened, and could not remain long
in the land, because we also had not much to eat. So
our commander asked their chief how many days&rsquo; journey
we yet had to the Amazons, and he said we must yet travel
one full month to reach them, and besides, all the land was
full of water, as it indeed appeared.</p>

<p>Now the chief of the Orthuses presented our commander
with four Pleynisch<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> of gold, and four silver rings which
they wear on the arm; but the Indians wear the plates on
their foreheads for ornaments, as our nobles do their gold
chains on their necks. For all this, our commander gave the
chief of the Indians a hatchet, knives, paternosters, scissors,
and other things which are made at Nuremberg. We would
have wished more from them, but we durst not ask it, for
we Christians were not numerous enough, and therefore had
to beware of them. The Indians, on the contrary, were very
numerous, and their town so large, that I had hitherto never
seen in the whole of India so many people together, nor such
a big place, although I have been far and wide. The mortality
among the Indians, dying from hunger, certainly was
our good luck, for otherwise we Christians might not perhaps
have escaped with our lives.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_173_173" id="Footnote_173_173" href="#FNanchor_173_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> Plates.</p>
</div>

<p>When we again returned to the aforesaid Siberis, we
were ill-provided with victual, for they had nothing to
eat but a tree called a palm, and cardes,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and other
roots which grow underground. And when we came to the
Scherues, our people were half dead for sickness, because of
the water and the poverty that we had to undergo during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-&nbsp;49&nbsp;-</a></span>
journey, for we never came out of the water for thirty days
and nights together, and we were always constrained to drink
of that impure water.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_174_174" id="Footnote_174_174" href="#FNanchor_174_174"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> Thistles.</p>
</div>

<p>So we remained among the Scherues, where the King lives,
for four days, and they treated us very well, and waited on
us diligently, and the King ordered his subjects to give us
all things necessary.</p>

<p>On this journey each of us plundered nearly two hundred
ducats&rsquo; worth of Indian cotton mantles and silver,
having secretly bartered these for knives, paternosters,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
scissors, and looking-glasses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_175_175" id="Footnote_175_175" href="#FNanchor_175_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> Rosaries.</p>
</div>

<p>After all this we again went down the river to our chief
commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and when we
arrived, he ordered us on our lives not to come out of the
ships, and he came also in person to us and ordered our
commander, Ernando Rieffere,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> to be cast into prison, and took
from us soldiers all that we had brought with us from the
country; and finally, he would have hanged our commander,
Ernando Rieffere, on a tree. But when we heard of this, we
being still in the Bergentin,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> raised a great tumult along with
other good friends who were on shore, against our chief commander,
Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, demanding that he
should set our commander, Ernando Rieffere, free, and restore
to us all of that which he had taken away, otherwise we
should take measures accordingly. Seeing such an uproar
and our wrathful indignation, he was very glad indeed to
let our commander go free, and to restore to us all he had
taken away, giving us fair words that we might be pacified;
how it fared with him afterwards shall presently be told.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_176_176" id="Footnote_176_176" href="#FNanchor_176_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca.</p>

</div>

<p>All this having occurred, and peace being established, he
desired our commander, Ernando Rieffere, and us to give
him a report on the country we had been to; and explain how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-&nbsp;50&nbsp;-</a></span>
it happened that we had remained so long absent; and we
gave him an answer wherewith he was well satisfied. That
he had received us so badly and taken our things away, was
the result of our not having obeyed his mandate; for he had
only ordered us to go as far as the Scherues,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and four
days&rsquo; journey inland, and then to return and report to him;
we on the contrary had gone for eighteen days beyond the
country of the Scherues.</p>

</div>

<p>Now our chief commander, after the report we had made
of it, would have marched with all his people to that country
to which we had just been; but we soldiers would not agree
thereto, especially at this very time when the country was
quite under water.</p>

<p>Moreover, most of the people were very feeble and ill,
besides which our chief commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de
Bacha, commanded no great respect or favour among the
soldiers, for he was a man who had never held a command nor
any important post whatsoever.</p>

<p>So we remained for two months among the aforesaid
Siberis (Surukusis?), during which time our chief commander
got a fever, which made him very ill&mdash;it would have been
no great loss had he died at this time, for he really commanded
no great respect among us.</p>

<p>In this country of the Surukusis I did not find a single
Indian who was forty or fifty years of age, nor have I ever
in my life experienced a more unhealthy country; for it lies
under the tropic, <i>i.e.</i>, there where the sun is at the highest;
it is as unhealthy as Sancte Thome.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Being among the Surukusis, I saw the constellation of Ursa
Major, of which we had lost sight when we passed the island
of S. Augo.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

observes that in the tropic of Capricorn, in which Surukusis is situated,
the elevation of the pole is 22&frac12;&deg;, and the constellation of Ursa Major
would be visible here at its highest elevation in the sky for several
hours. The author&rsquo;s remark that he lost sight of this constellation
at the island of St. Iago is, according to the same commentator,
wholly erroneous. This island is in N. lat. 15&deg;; the declination of the
star &alpha; Urs&aelig; Majoris, the northernmost of the group, is 62&deg; 20&prime; 2&Prime;. It
would therefore appear on the horizon in S. lat. 27&deg; 40&prime;, or 2,560
miles south of St. Iago.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-&nbsp;51&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Now our commander-in-chief ordered, in spite of his
illness, one hundred and fifty Christians and two thousand
Indian Carios to go with four Bergentin ships,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> four miles
distance to the island of the Surukusis, and commanded
them to slay all these Surukusis or to take them prisoners,
and that they should principally destroy all persons from
forty to fifty years of age. The way these Surukusis had
previously entertained us has already been declared,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and
how we rewarded and thanked them will now appear. God
knows that we did them wrong.</p>

</div>

<p>When, therefore, we arrived at their town unawares, they
came out of their houses with bows and arrows to meet us
peaceably. But a tumult arising between the Carios and the
Surukusis, we Christians fired at them and killed very many,
and having made more than two thousand prisoners, men,
women, boys, and girls, we afterwards burnt down their town,
and took all they possessed that could be carried away, as in
such violent assaults is usual; then we turned back again
to our commander, Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, who was
very well pleased with our deeds.</p>

<p>But our people being for the most part feeble and ill-affected
towards our chief commander, the latter could not
do anything with them, so he ordered a ship to be prepared,
and we all went down the river Paraboe,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and came to Noster
Signora desumsion,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> where we had left the other Christians.
There our chief commander fell sick again of a fever, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">-&nbsp;52&nbsp;-</a></span>
kept indoors fourteen days together. It was, however, more
out of pride than out of weakness, for he did not please the
people; but showed himself unseemly towards them more
than it behoved a lord or commander who would govern a
country; for such a man should always give good counsel to
everyone alike whatever their rank or station, and always be
good-hearted to all. Also it seems well that such an one
should so behave himself as he would like to appear to
others, and should be wiser and cleverer than those whom he
commands. For it is very bad and shameful that anyone
should try to advance more in honours than in wisdom. And
nobody should boast himself of his high position, despising
others, like the vain and arrogant Thrasus<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> in Terentius, who
thinks that every commander is appointed for the sake of
the men, and not the soldiers nominated for the commander&rsquo;s
sake.</p>

</div>

<p>But here there has been no regard as to persons, but our
commander has in all things only followed his arrogant and
vain inspiration.</p>

<p>Thereupon it was resolved by all, noble man and commoner,
to meet in council, with a view to take prisoner this chief commander,
Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha, and to send him to
H. I. Majesty, and to report to His Majesty about his nice
virtue, and how he had behaved towards us, and how, according
to his reason, he had governed; and other things besides.</p>

<p>According to the resolution come to, these three gentlemen,
namely, the treasurer or judge, the clerk or master of the
toll or custom, and the secretary ordained by H. I. Majesty,
whose names were Albernunzo Gabrero, Don Francisco
Manchossa, Garze Hannego, Philippo de Gastra,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> etc., taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-&nbsp;53&nbsp;-</a></span>
with them two hundred soldiers, went to his lodging, and
arrested our commander-in-chief, Albernunzo Cabessa de
Bacha, when he least expected it. And this happened on
St. Mark&rsquo;s Day, Anno 1543.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> They held prisoner the said
Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha for a whole year, until a ship
called a Carrabella,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> provided with victual and a crew, had
been prepared. And on board this ship the often-mentioned
Cabessa de Bacha, with two other officers on behalf of H. I.
Majesty, were conveyed to Spain.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_188_188" id="Footnote_188_188" href="#FNanchor_188_188"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> This conspiracy against Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez was the work of Domingo
Martinez de Irala to get possession of the Government, in which he
succeeded. Schmidt avows himself an accomplice, and this explains
his unjust charges against the Adelantado, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de
Vaca, who was the most honest and capable governor that this unfortunate
colony had in early times. The imprisonment took place on
the 25th of April 1544, and lasted one year, during which Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez
suffered the most horrible treatment from his wicked enemies.</p>

<p>After that we had to elect another who should rule and
govern the country until H. I. Majesty had time to designate
one himself. And we held it for good, as it was the meaning
and the will of the community, to nominate as chief Domingo
Eijollas,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> not only because he had formerly governed the
country, but especially because most of the soldiers were
satisfied with him.</p>

</div>

<p>However, there were some who had been the special
friends of our aforesaid chief commander, Albernunzo
Cabessa de Bacha, who were not pleased. But we did not
care for that.</p>

<p>About this time I was very weak and ill with dropsy,
which I, along with my fellow-comrades, had caught in our
journey to the Orthuses, when we waded so long in the
water, besides suffering want and intolerable hunger, as I
have related; for nearly eighty of our people fell ill, and
not more than thirty men escaped death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-&nbsp;54&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>And when Albernunzo Cabessa de Bacha was sent to
Spain there was discord among us Christians, and soon we
fought day and night, so that any one would have thought
that the devil governed among us; and no man was safe
from the other.</p>

<p>We thus made war among ourselves for two whole years,
the sending away Cabessa de Bacha being the occasion of it.
And when the Carios, who had formerly been our friends,
perceived that we Christians were disunited, and had such
false and treacherous hearts one towards another, they were
not at all pleased, for they thought that every realm that is
divided in itself and cannot agree must be destroyed. They
therefore held a council, and agreed that they would kill us
and drive us out of their country. But God Almighty&mdash;praise
to Him, always and everlastingly&mdash;did not grant
these Carios that their designs should prosper; although the
whole country of the Carios and other nations, such as
the Aygais,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> were against us Christians.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_191_191" id="Footnote_191_191" href="#FNanchor_191_191"><span class="label">[191]</span></a> Agazes.</p>
</div>

<p>But when we perceived this state of things we were
obliged to make peace among ourselves. And we also
entered into a treaty with two other tribes, one named the
Jeperis, and the other the Bachacheis,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> who numbered five
thousand men in all. They eat only fish and flesh, are
courageous in battle on land and water, but prefer fighting on
land. Their weapons are tardes,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> half a spear in length but
not so thick, and the points are tipped with flint. They
have also truncheons under their girdles four spans long
with a knob at the end.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_192_192" id="Footnote_192_192" href="#FNanchor_192_192"><span class="label">[192]</span></a> Yapir&uacute;s and Mbai&aacute;s.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_193_193" id="Footnote_193_193" href="#FNanchor_193_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> Darts.</p>
</div>

<p>Every one of these Indians has also ten or twelve small
sticks of wood, or as many in fact as he chooses to carry, a
good span long, and on the point of every stick is fixed a
broad and long fish&rsquo;s tooth (named Palmede<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> in Spanish)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-&nbsp;55&nbsp;-</a></span>
that resembles a sea-tench. This tooth cuts like a razor;
but you should know what they do with these teeth, or what
use they put them to.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194" href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> Palometa.</p>
</div>

<p>Firstly, they fight with the aforesaid tardes, and in case
they are victorious over their enemies, and that these take
to flight, they abandon their tardes and run after the enemies
and throw their truncheons under their feet, in order to
cause them to fall to the ground; then, without looking to
see if they are yet half-alive or dead, they cut their heads off
with the aforesaid fish-tooth. This is done so quickly that
one has scarcely time enough to turn round; afterwards they
put this tooth back again under their girdle or their other
clothing.</p>

<p>Mark you, now, what he does further with the man&rsquo;s
head, and to what use he puts it, namely, if he has any opportunity
for so doing, after such a skirmish. He takes off the
skin with all the hair over the ears, then he fills the head out
and leaves it to become hard; afterwards he puts this hard
and dry skin on a little hoop as a souvenir, in the same way
as here in Germany a knight or commander puts a scutcheon
in the churches.</p>

<p>But to return to our narrative, and to make it short. It
so happened that the Jeperis and Bachacheis<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> came to us with
about one thousand men, which pleased us very much; we
then went out of the town Noster Signora Desumsion with
our chief commander, besides three hundred and fifty Christians
and these one thousand Indians, so that every Christian
had three men to look after him, whom our commander had
ordered for them. And we came afterwards to a distance
of three miles from the place where our enemies the Carios,
who numbered fifteen thousand, were encamped in the open,
in good order. Now when we were only half a mile from
them we would do nothing that day for we were tired and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-&nbsp;56&nbsp;-</a></span>
was raining; so we remained in the wood, where we passed
the night. The following morning we marched against them
at six o&rsquo;clock, and coming upon them by seven, we fought
together till ten. Then they were obliged to fly, and ran
in haste to a place four miles distant, which they had fortified,
and its name was called Froemiliere.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The Indian chief was
Machkaria. In this skirmish the dead on the enemy&rsquo;s side
who were killed by us numbered two thousand, whose heads
the Jeperis<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> carried on their spears. And on our side there
fell ten Christians besides the wounded, whom we sent back
to Noster Signora Desumsion; but we pursued the enemy
with all our army to their place Froemiliere, whither
Machkaria their chief had fled. But these Carios had fortified
their place with three wooden stockades, like a wall. The
wooden posts were as thick as a man in the middle part of
his body, or even thicker, three fathoms high, and sunk
into the earth the height of a man.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_195_195" id="Footnote_195_195" href="#FNanchor_195_195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> Yapir&uacute;s and Mbai&aacute;s.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_196_196" id="Footnote_196_196" href="#FNanchor_196_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> It is impossible to interpret this name, which certainly is not

</div>

<p>They had also dug pits or deep holes, and planted in each
of them five or six pointed stakes as sharp as needles. So this
town of theirs was very strong, and contained many valiant
warriors; there can be no doubt about that. And we lay
three days before that place without being able to do anything
or to win anything from them.</p>

<p>However, at length, by God&rsquo;s help, we became stronger
than they were.</p>

<p>We soon made great <i>Bodelle</i> or <i>Pabesse</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> out of the skins
of deer and of the <i>amida</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> This is a big beast, like a good-sized
mule; it has feet like a cow, but on the whole resembles
an ass; and its flesh is suitable to be eaten. There are
plenty of them in this country; and their skin is half a finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-&nbsp;57&nbsp;-</a></span>
thick. Such a pabesse we gave to every Indian of the Jeperis,
and to others a good hatchet, and between two such Indians
we placed an arquebuss shooter. There were over four
hundred of these targets.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_198_198" id="Footnote_198_198" href="#FNanchor_198_198"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> Spanish words, <i>rodela</i> or <i>pav&eacute;s</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, shields and targets.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_199_199" id="Footnote_199_199" href="#FNanchor_199_199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> Anta or tapir.</p>
</div>

<p>Then we again attacked the enemy&rsquo;s town from three sides
between two and three o&rsquo;clock in the morning; and, in less
than three hours, the three stockades were destroyed and
won; we then came with all our people into the town and
slew many men, women, and children. But most of them
escaped and fled to another place of theirs called Carieba,
twenty miles distant from this place Froemiliere. This town
they also fortified, and there was a great mass of these
Carios there together. This town stood very close to a big
forest, in order that if we Christians again conquered it, they
might retain the forest as a protection, as will be seen hereafter.
Now, when we Christians, along with our Commander
Martino Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> together with the aforesaid
Jeperis and Bachacheis, had followed our enemies the Carios
up to this place Carieba, at about five o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
we established our army on three sides of the place, on a
concealed eminence in the forest. There came also reinforcements
to us from Noster Signora Desumsion,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> two hundred
Christians and five hundred Jeperis and Bachacheis,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> because
many of our people, Christians and Indians, had been
wounded before the aforesaid place, so that we were compelled
to send them back and to have these fresh soldiers instead of
them. Now, therefore, we numbered four hundred and fifty
Christians and one thousand three hundred Jeperis and
Bachacheis. But our enemies the Carios had now fortified
their place more strongly than ever, namely with palissadoes
(stockades) and very many trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-&nbsp;58&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>They had also prepared iron plates,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> which were made
like rat traps, of which a single one, if it had gone according
to their wish, would have each time slain twenty or thirty
men. There were plenty of these traps in the place, but
God Almighty willed otherwise, so praise be to Him everlastingly.
We lay, therefore, before this place, Carieba, four
days without being able to do them any harm; but at length,
by treachery (such as is to be found everywhere), there came
an Indian from our enemies, the Carios, at night to our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> That Indian was one of
the chiefs of the Carios, and to him belonged the town.
This man bade us not to burn down his town, nor to destroy
it; and if we consented, he was willing to show us the
manner in which we could take the place. Our commander
promised this to him, and that no harm should be done him.
Accordingly this Cario showed us two paths in the forest
by which we could penetrate into the place, and said that
he would light a fire in his town, and during that time we
should break into it. All this having been done, we
Christians entered the town and slew a great number of
people. Those who took to flight ran right into the hands
of their enemies, the Jeperis, by whom the greater part were
killed. But this time they had not their wives and children
with them, having concealed them in a great wood four
leagues distant from that place.</p>

<p>Those among the Carios who had escaped this conflict fled
to another Indian chief, named Thabere,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and the village
which entertained them is called Juberich Sabaije.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> It is
at one hundred and forty miles distance from Carieba, and
we could neither pursue them, nor make that journey,
because the whole way they had passed they had wasted far
and near with fire, in order that we might not find anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">-&nbsp;59&nbsp;-</a></span>
to eat; but we remained fourteen days at Carieba, where we
healed the wounded and rested the while.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>Then we went again to our town, Noster Signora Desumsion,
in order to be enabled to sail up the river and seek out
the aforesaid place, Juberich Sabaije, where the Indian
chief Thabere lived.</p>

<p>When we came to our town, Noster Signora Desumsion,
we also remained there fourteen days, in order to provide
ourselves with all sorts of victual and ammunition for the
journey. Our commander now took reinforcements with him&mdash;Christians
and Indians&mdash;because many had been wounded
and many were ill.</p>

<p>We then went up the river Paraboe<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> to our enemies&rsquo;
town, Juberich Sabaije, with nine Bergentin ships and two
hundred canoes and one thousand five hundred Indians.
According to the Jeperis it was forty-six miles distant from
Noster Signora desumsion to Juberich Sabaije, whither our
enemies, the Carieba, had fled.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_207_207" id="Footnote_207_207" href="#FNanchor_207_207"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> Paraguai.</p>
</div>

<p>On the way thither the chief of the Carios, the same
who had betrayed the town, met us; and he brought with him
one thousand Carios to aid us against the aforesaid Thabere.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Now, when our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> had
assembled all these people together at two miles distance from
Juberich Sabaije, he sent two Carios Indians to their enemies
in the town to warn them that the Christians were there
again; and to tell them that they should return to their
country, each of them to his wife and children, and should
be obedient to the Christians and serve them again, as they
had done before, and if they refused we would drive them all
out of the country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_208_208" id="Footnote_208_208" href="#FNanchor_208_208"><span class="label">[208]</span></a> Tabar&eacute;.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_209_209" id="Footnote_209_209" href="#FNanchor_209_209"><span class="label">[209]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>
</div>

<p>Thereupon the chief Cario, Thabere,<a name="FNanchor_208_208_2" id="FNanchor_208_208_2" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> answered that they
should tell the Christian chiefs that he knew neither them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-&nbsp;60&nbsp;-</a></span>
nor the Christians, and would put us Christians to death;
indeed they severely beat our two Indians and told them
to disappear very quickly out of their camp else they would
kill them.</p>

<p>The two messengers came back to our commander, and
brought him the tidings how they had been treated. Thereupon
Martin Domingo Eijolla was at one accord with us,
and we advanced against our enemy, Thabere,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and the
Carios, in order of battle, dividing our army into four parts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_210_210" id="Footnote_210_210" href="#FNanchor_210_210"><span class="label">[210]</span></a> Tabar&eacute;.</p>
</div>

<p>We came to a river called Sthuesia,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> which is as wide as
the river Danube in our land, half the height of a man deep,
and in some places even deeper, and it becomes at times
very great and causes much harm in the country, and by
reason of such inundation it is impossible to travel through
the country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_211_211" id="Footnote_211_211" href="#FNanchor_211_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> This may be the river Xejuy, or the Ipan&eacute;, affluents of the river
Paraguai.</p>
</div>

<p>As we had to cross this river, our enemies being on
the other side with their camp, they resisted us and did us a
great deal of harm in the crossing, so that I even believe
that none of us had come out of it with his life but for the
grace of God which was beforehand on our side and but for
the guns that we had.</p>

<p>So God Almighty gave us His divine grace that we crossed
the water by His divine benediction, and landed on the other
side. Now, when the enemies saw that we had passed, they
fled at once towards their town, which was half a mile from the
river, but we, seeing it, pursued them with all our forces and
came to the town as quickly as they themselves and besieged
it, so that none should enter or come out of it; we
also armed ourselves forthwith with our guns and pikes, and
by the grace of God Almighty we had only to stay from the
morning till night to overpower them, and become masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">-&nbsp;61&nbsp;-</a></span>
over them. We took the place, and slaughtered much
people.</p>

<p>However, before we attacked them, our commander ordered
us not to kill the women and children, but to take them
prisoners; and we dutifully obeyed his commands. But all
the men we could get hold of had to die; yet many escaped
by flight, and our friends, the Jeperi,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> took nearly one thousand
heads from our enemies, the Carios.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_212_212" id="Footnote_212_212" href="#FNanchor_212_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> Yapir&uacute;s. This word is sometimes rendered in the original
&ldquo;Jeperus&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<p>After all this had happened, those Carios who had escaped
came with their chief, Thaberus,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and several other chiefs to
our commander, and entreated him for mercy that their wives
and children might be restored them, and then they would
become friends again with us, and serve us faithfully.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_213_213" id="Footnote_213_213" href="#FNanchor_213_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> Tabar&eacute;.</p>
</div>

<p>Thereupon our commander promised them to be merciful,
and took them into favour, and ever afterwards they continued
our good friends so long as I remained in the country.
This war with the Carios lasted for one year and a half, <i>i.e.</i>,
that we never had peace with one another, and that we were
never sure of them; and this happened in the year 1546.</p>

<p>Afterwards we again went to Noster Signora desumsion,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
and remained there fully two years. But when during all
this time no ships or tidings arrived from Spain, our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> assembled all the people
and asked them if it pleased them that he should go with
some people into the country to inquire if gold and silver
were to be found. The people answered him to do it in God&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_214_214" id="Footnote_214_214" href="#FNanchor_214_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> The town of La Asuncion.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_215_215" id="Footnote_215_215" href="#FNanchor_215_215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly he collected together three hundred and
fifty Spaniards, and asked them if they would accompany
him, provided he found them in all necessaries for the
journey, such as Indians, horses, and clothing; they declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-&nbsp;62&nbsp;-</a></span>
their willingness to go. Then he had the chiefs of the
Carios assembled, and asked them if two thousand of their
number would go with him. They declared themselves
ready to go and be obedient unto him.</p>

<p>With such friendly accord on both sides our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla, in a little more than two months
went with this folk in the year 1548 up the river Paraboe,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
with seven Bergentin ships and two hundred canoes. Those
of the people who could not go in the ships or canoes went
on foot by land with the one hundred and thirty horses.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
And coming by land and by water all together to a round
and high mountain, called S. Fernando, where the aforesaid
Peyembas<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> live, our commander there ordered the five ships
and the canoes to go back to Noster Signora Desumsion.
The other two Bergentin ships he left there at S. Fernando,
with fifty Spaniards, under the command of Peter Diess<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>;
he gave them also victuals and other necessaries for one year,
and ordered them to wait there till he returned from the
country, that the fate which befell the good gentleman
Johann Eijollas<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and his companions, all of whom were
so dreadfully killed by the Peyembas,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> might not also
happen to him and his folk. God have mercy upon them
all. I have narrated this before.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_217_217" id="Footnote_217_217" href="#FNanchor_217_217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> The expedition was composed of 250 Spaniards, and twenty-seven

mountains extending from 17&deg; to 21&deg; of south lat.</p>
</div>

<p>Then our commander went straight on with three hundred
Christians, one hundred and thirty horses, and three hundred
Carios, for eight full days without finding any people at all.
On the ninth day we found a nation called Naperus, who
have nothing to eat but meat and fish; they are tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-&nbsp;63&nbsp;-</a></span>
powerful; their wives have their nakedness covered, and are
not at all beautiful.</p>

<p>From the aforesaid mountain S. Fernando to this nation
the distance is thirty-six miles. Here we passed the night,
and then went travelling seven days more, when we came to
a people called Maipai.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> They are a very numerous people,
and have subjects who must plough the land and fish for
them, and generally do whatever they are ordered, just as at
home the peasants are subject to the noble lords. This
nation is well provided with Turkish corn, mandeochade,
mandepore parpii, padades, mandues,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> bachkeku, and other
roots useful for eating. They also have deer, Indian sheep,
ostriches, ducks, geese, poultry, and other fowl.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_222_222" id="Footnote_222_222" href="#FNanchor_222_222"><span class="label">[222]</span></a> Mepenes, who are Abipones.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_223_223" id="Footnote_223_223" href="#FNanchor_223_223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> These victuals are: maize, manioc, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pea-nuts,
and perhaps bananas, which the author calls &ldquo;bachkeku&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<p>Their forests are full of honey out of which wine is prepared
and other things are made, and the farther you go into
the country the more fertile you will find it. They have all
the year round Turkish corn in the fields, and other roots as
well. Their sheep, which are in a wild state, they use as we
do our horses, for riding and carrying purposes.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> I myself,
having one foot ailing, once rode on such a sheep for more
than forty miles, though not in this journey. In Peru goods
are conveyed on these sheep as on horses at home.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_224_224" id="Footnote_224_224" href="#FNanchor_224_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> These are the Peruvian llamas, and guanacos, from which the
Indians took the wool, and wove rough cloth.</p>
</div>

<p>These Maijeaijs<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> are tall, erect, and warlike, giving all their
care to warlike affairs. Their wives are very beautiful and
have their nakedness covered. They do no work in the fields;
the man has to look after the food. Neither at home does
the woman anything else but spin wool, and prepare food,
and also what pleases the man and other good companions
who pray her to do it, etc. We won&rsquo;t say anything more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">-&nbsp;64&nbsp;-</a></span>
about it; he who likes to see it, shall go thither, and
if he does not otherwise believe it, he will find it out for
himself.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_225_225" id="Footnote_225_225" href="#FNanchor_225_225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> Mbai&aacute;s.</p>
</div>

<p>When we were not above half a mile distant from this
people they met us on the way, where there was a small
clearing, where they told our commander that we should
remain for the night, and they would bring us whatsoever
we had need of, but they did this out of malice; and to win
more confidence, they presented our commander with four
silver crowns to wear on the head, and they gave him besides
six silver plates, each of which was one and a half span
long and half a span wide.</p>

<p>These plates they bind on the forehead as ornaments,
as we have told before. They also presented our commander
with three beautiful young women. However, whilst
we remained in that place, after supper we stationed sentries,
in order that the people might be on the alert for the
enemy, and afterwards we went to rest.</p>

<p>About midnight our commander lost his young wenches.
In short, there was great excitement in the camp for that
reason, and as soon as the morning dawned, our commander
ordered that each of us should stand to his quarters with his
arms ready.</p>

<p>So the aforesaid Maijeaijs,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> numbering twenty thousand,
came to attack us unawares, but they did not do us much
harm. On the contrary, in this conflict, more than one
thousand of their men were left dead; and they fled and we
pursued them to their town, but we did not find anything
therein, not so much as their wives and children. Then
our commander, taking with him one hundred and fifty
gunners and two thousand five hundred Indian Carios,
ordered us to follow the Maijeaijs, which we did for three
days and two nights together, taking no more rest than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-&nbsp;65&nbsp;-</a></span>
time necessary for our dinner and four or five hours for sleep
at night.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226" href="#FNanchor_226_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> Mbai&aacute;s.</p>
</div>

<p>The third day we suddenly came upon the Maijaijs,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> with
their women and children gathered together in a forest with
them; these were not the people we sought, but their
friends. They did not fear at all our coming to them.
Nevertheless, the innocent had to pay for the guilty, for
when we lighted upon them we killed many, and took over
three thousand prisoners, men, women, and children; and,
if it had been day-time instead of night, none of them
would have escaped, for there was a goodly number of
people gathered together on the hill, at the summit of which
was a great wood.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_227_227" id="Footnote_227_227" href="#FNanchor_227_227"><span class="label">[227]</span></a> Mbai&aacute;s.</p>
</div>

<p>I, for my part, in this skirmish, captured over nineteen
persons, men and women, who were not at all old&mdash;I have
always had more esteem for young than for old people&mdash;also
I took Indian mantles and other things besides as my
share of the booty. Then we returned to our camp and
remained there for eight days, because there was now plenty
of victual. The distance from these Maijaijs to Mount S.
Fernando, where we left our two ships, is seventy miles.
Afterwards we went further, to a people called Zchemui,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-&nbsp;66&nbsp;-</a></span><a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
who are subject to the aforesaid Maijaijs, as here at home
the peasants are subject to their landlords.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_228_228" id="Footnote_228_228" href="#FNanchor_228_228"><span class="label">[228]</span></a> Perhaps Chan&eacute;s. To the tribe which Schmidt calls Zchemui, and
to all the other tribes mentioned in his voyage north in search of
<i>El Dorado</i>, he gives such queer and extraordinary names, that it is
impossible to interpret them. De Barcia, the Spanish translator from
the Latin version, who consulted other documents, declares that they
are unintelligible, and generally puts down the equivalents as given
by the Latin translator. The last named of those tribes is the one
that Schmidt calls Machkokios, on arriving at the Salinas del Jaur&uacute;
in lat. 16&deg; S. Not far from there he finds another river, to which he
gives the same name. This was the river Guapay. He goes across it
and meets Spaniards, who tell him they belong to the Gobernacion
(Government) of Pero Anzures. Irala stops there and sends messengers
to the Governor of Peru, La Gasca, to whom he offers his services.
La Gasca refuses them, and orders him back to the Gobernacion of
the River Plate.</p>

<p>The translators, who in other languages have tried to interpret these
names, have done it in an arbitrary manner. The unintelligible names
are the following: Peihoni, Tohanna, Symani, Barchkoni, Zeyhanni,
Karchkoni, Siberi, Peijesseni, Jeronimus, Maigeni, Karchkockies,
Marchkockios and rio Machkasies. None of them are Indian names.</p>
</div>

<p>On the way we found many fields sown with Turkish
corn and other roots, of which one can eat all the year
round, for before one crop is stored another is already
ripe for harvest, and when this too is gathered it is time
to sow a third, so that there is always abundance of food.</p>

<p>We came to a little open space belonging to the Zchemui,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
and, when they saw us, they all fled away. We remained
there for two days, and found in that place, which is four
miles from the Maijaijs,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> plenty to eat.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_229_229" id="Footnote_229_229" href="#FNanchor_229_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> Chan&eacute;s.</p>

</div>

<p>From thence we went in two days six miles to a nation
named Thohonna; we did not find any men here, but plenty
to eat. They also are subjects to the Maijaijs. Departing
thence, we travelled for six days, and did not find any
people; but on the seventh we came to a nation called
Peihoni. They were gathered in great numbers, and their
chief came to meet us with a great multitude of people in a
peaceful way. This chief besought our commander that we
should not enter their place, but that we should stay outside
in the place where he came to meet us. Our commander,
however, would not agree to that, and, will he nill he, straightway
entered their town; here we found plenty of meat and
food, such as hens, geese, deer, sheep, ostriches, parrots,
<i>kuniglin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> etc., not to mention Turkish corn and other roots
and fruits, all in great abundance. But water is scarce, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-&nbsp;67&nbsp;-</a></span>
there is no gold or silver. So we did not ask for that, for
fear that the other nations living further up should flee
away before we came to them.</p>

</div>

<p>With these Peihoni we stayed four days, and our commander
asked them many things about the nature and
condition of the country.</p>

<p>From the Thohonna to these Peihoni the distance is
twenty-four miles. Departing from there we obtained from
the Peihoni an interpreter and guide, who showed us the
road, in order that we might get water to drink, for there
is great scarcity of water in this country. At four miles
distance we came to a people called Maijegoni, and stayed
one day there, and again asked for an interpreter and guide
to show us the way. They were willing to do this, and they
gave us our necessaries.</p>

<p>Departing from these we went further for eight miles and
came to a people called Marroni. They are a very numerous
people, and received us very well. We abode here two days
with them, and received information of the country. They
also promised to show us the way. Then we went further
for four miles to a nation called Parroni, who have not much
to eat. They number three or four thousand fighting-men,
and we remained only one day amongst them.</p>

<p>From there we went twelve miles further to a nation
named Symanni, where a great multitude of people were
gathered together on a high mountain. Their village is surrounded
with a thorny wood like a wall.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> They received us
with their bows and arrows, and gave us tardes<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> to eat. But
it did not last long with them; they were soon compelled
to leave the place, but they burnt all down before leaving.
We, however, found enough to eat in the fields, and remained
for three days there, seeking for them in the woods
and in the fields.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-&nbsp;68&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>From there we went four days and came to a people called
Barchkonis. These did not await our coming, but as soon
as we approached their town betook themselves to flight;
yet they could not escape us. We asked them for food,
and they brought us hens, geese, sheep, ostriches, deer, and
other necessaries, with which we were well satisfied; and we
remained four days among them to learn about the country.</p>

<p>From there we went twelve miles in three days to a people
called Zeyhannis. These had but little food, for the locusts
had eaten up everything; so we remained only one night there,
and then went four days&rsquo; journey, twenty miles further,
to a people called Karchkonis. There also the locusts had
been at work, but had not done so much harm as in other
places. We only abode one day among them, and took
knowledge of the country. They also told us that for a
distance of thirty miles we should find no water until we
came to a people called Siberis.</p>

<p>We then took two Indians, who showed us the way, and
in six days we came to these Siberis; but many of our people
died from thirst, although we took water with us, on the
journey from the Karchkonis. But in this journey we found
in certain places a root above ground, having great, wide
leaves<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> wherein the water remains and cannot get out, nor
is it consumed by them, exactly as if it were in a vase.
One such root contains nearly half a measure of water.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_234_234" id="Footnote_234_234" href="#FNanchor_234_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> The author uses the word <i>Wurzel</i> here and in other places for
plant. Perhaps the Traveller&rsquo;s tree (<i>Urania speciosa</i>), with its graceful
crown of plantain-like leaves, is here referred to.</p>
</div>

<p>So we came, at two o&rsquo;clock in the night, to the aforesaid
Siberis, who would at once have fled with their wives and
children. But our commander caused them to be told,
through an interpreter, that they should remain in peace
and quiet in their houses, and that they should not fear
us. These Siberis also suffered from a great scarcity of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-&nbsp;69&nbsp;-</a></span>
for they have nothing else to drink. As it had not rained
for three months they were preparing a beverage out of a
root called mandepore,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> after this manner: they take the said
root and pound it in a mortar, and the juice they obtain
from it is like milk; but, if you have water at hand, you
may also prepare wine of this root.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_235_235" id="Footnote_235_235" href="#FNanchor_235_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> Mandioca or Manioc.</p>
</div>

<p>In that place there was only one spring, where we had to
station a guard in order to look after the water and to give in
a report on it. And our commander saw fit to select me for
this duty, that I might give out the water after the measure
that he had ordered, for the dearth was so great that one
would not ask for gold, or silver, or eatables, or anything
else, but for water. In this way I gained favour and grace
among noblemen and common folk alike, for I was not
too sparing of it; at the same time I had to be careful
that we did not run short. There is not to be found in all
this land a running stream, but all the water is collected in
cisterns. These Siberis also wage war with other Indians
for the sake of water.</p>

<p>With this people we remained two days, not knowing
what to do, whether we should advance or go back; we
therefore drew lots to decide the question. Meanwhile our
commander asked the Siberis about the country, and they
answered that we should have to go six days to reach a
people called Peijssenos, and that on our way we should find
two rivulets of drinkable water, and also the aforesaid
Cardes.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

are eaten and quench the thirst.</p>
</div>

<p>We then began our journey, and took some Siberis with
us to show the way. Three days&rsquo; journey from their
place these Siberis fled away one night, and we did not
see them any more. So we had to find out the way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-&nbsp;70&nbsp;-</a></span>
ourselves, and afterwards came to the Peijssenos, who put
themselves on their defence, and refused to become friends
with us. But this did not help them much; by the grace
of God we mastered them and took their town, and put
them to flight. However, we made several prisoners in
this skirmish, who told us how that they had had in their
town three Spaniards, one of whom was named Hieronimus,
who had been a drummer of Petro Manchossa.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> These
three Spaniards had been left sick there by the late Johann
Eijollas,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> amongst the aforesaid Peijssenos.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>The Peijssenos killed these three Spaniards four days
before we arrived, after they had heard of our coming through
the Siberis; they were, however, well punished by us for
it, for we remained fourteen days in their town, and sought
them out and found them, but not all of them, in a certain
wood. We killed all these, and took prisoners the rest,
the lesser part, who escaped. Those whom we took prisoners
were very willing in showing us the country. Then our
commander took note of all their sayings, which were of good
avail. Namely, they told us that we would have four days&rsquo;
journey, or sixteen miles to go, before reaching a people
called Maigenos.</p>

<p>When we reached the Maigenos, they put themselves on
their defence, and refused to be friendly with us. Their
town was on a little hill, surrounded by a thick, thorny
hedge, as high as a man might reach with his sword. We
Christians attacked this town, along with the Carios, on two
sides. But in this assault twelve Christians and several
of the Carios were killed before we won the place.</p>

<p>Now, seeing that we were masters of their town, the
Maigenos burned it down themselves, and speedily fled away,
several of whom, as may be readily believed, had to die.
Three days afterwards, five hundred Carios rose secretly, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-&nbsp;71&nbsp;-</a></span>
knowing nothing about it, and took their bows and arrows,
and having gone two or three miles from our camp, met
the Maigenos who were fleeing. And these two people fought
so desperately, that the Carios lost over three hundred men,
and the Maigenos so many, that it is not possible to describe
it, for they covered the space of a whole mile. But the
Carios sent messengers to our commander, and besought him
to come to their rescue because they were lying in the forest,
and were unable to advance or retire, being beleaguered
on all sides by the Maigenos.</p>

<p>As soon as our commander heard of this, without a
moment&rsquo;s delay he caused the horses, one hundred and fifty
Christians, together with one thousand of our Carios, to be
sent, the other people remaining in the camp to defend it, if
necessary, in order that our enemies, the Maigenos, might
not enter and overthrow it in our absence.</p>

<p>So there went out to help our friends, the Carios, with
the abovesaid horses, one hundred and fifty Christians and
one thousand Carios. But as soon as the Maigenos saw us
coming, they broke up their camp and fled away swiftly, but
we pursued them, without, however, being able to overtake
them. How it befell them at the last, when we returned to
the town whence we had come, will be presently narrated.</p>

<p>So we came to the Carios, and found a wonderful number
of them and of their enemies, the Maigenos, lying dead. Our
friends, the Carios, those who were still alive, were greatly
pleased that we were come to help them.</p>

<p>After that we returned with them to our camp and abode
there four days, for we had plenty to eat and all things
needful in this town of the Maigenos.</p>

<p>We then resolved to undertake our decisive journey, having
now knowledge of the country. So we journeyed for
thirteen consecutive days, that is to say, according to our judgment,
about seventy-two miles, and came to a nation named
Karchkockios; and when we were <i>en route</i> the first nine days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-&nbsp;72&nbsp;-</a></span>
we came to a region six miles either way, on which there
was nothing but good salt as thick as if it had snowed,
and that salt remains winter and summer.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_239_239" id="Footnote_239_239" href="#FNanchor_239_239"><span class="label">[239]</span></a> This place is the Salinas del Jaur&uacute; (salt lakes of Jaur&uacute;).</p>
</div>

<p>We remained two days in this salt region, not knowing
how to come out of it or how to take the right way to continue
our journey. But God Almighty gave us His grace
that we found the right way, and in four days we came to a
people called Karchkockios, and when we were at only four
miles distance from their town, our commander sent in
advance fifty Christians and five hundred Carios that they
might provide lodging for us.</p>

<p>Now when we had entered the town, we found a numerous
people together, the like of which we had not as yet
seen in all our journey, and we were put somewhat in fear
by it. Seeing this, we sent one of our men back to our commander,
to tell him how matters were, and that he might
come speedily to our help.</p>

<p>And when our commander heard these tidings, he set
forward with all his people on the very same night, and by
the morning, between three and four o&rsquo;clock, he was in the
midst of us; but the Karchkockios, supposing that there were
not more of us than they had seen the evening before,
promised themselves the victory.</p>

<p>But when they were aware that our commander had come
with more people they were very sad and sorrowful, and
showed us all possible kindness and goodwill, for they could
have done nothing more, and feared for their wives and
children and their village. Meanwhile they brought us
venison, geese, sheep, ostriches, ducks, conies, and other
game and fowl, as well as Turkish corn, wheat, rice, and
other roots which abound in their country. The men wear a
round blue stone in their lips, as broad as a draughtsman.
Their weapons are darts, bows and arrows, and targets made of
<i>amida</i> hide. Their wives have a small hole in their lips in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-&nbsp;73&nbsp;-</a></span>
which they insert a green or grey crystal. They wear a cotton
waistcloth about the size of a shirt, but without sleeves.
They are beautiful women, and do nothing but sew and keep
house; the men till the fields and provide all kinds of food.</p>

<p>From there we went to the Machkockios<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and took some of
the Karchkockios with us to show us the way. And after
three days&rsquo; journeying from this place the said Karchkockios<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
left us secretly, but we nevertheless continued our journey
and came to a river named Machkasis, one mile and a half
broad; and we did not know how to pass over it safely;
but with God&rsquo;s grace we passed it well in the following way:
for every two persons we made a raft of wood and branches,
whereon being carried down the river they came to the other
side; and in this passage four of our people were drowned.
God be merciful to them and to us. Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>This river has good fish in it. Many tigers are also
found in the neighbourhood. This river is only four miles
distant from the Machkockios.</p>

<p>When we had approached within one mile of the Machkasis
the inhabitants came forth to meet us, and received us very
well, and soon began talking Spanish with us; whereat we
were astonished, and asked them whose subjects they were
and who was their lord; they answered our commander and
us, that they were the subjects of a Spanish nobleman, whose
name was Peter Asuelles.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Upon entering their village we found their children, and
some of the men and women, swarming with very little
vermin, like our fleas. These little vermin, if they lay hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-&nbsp;74&nbsp;-</a></span>
of the toes, or any other part of the body, gnaw and enter
always more and more deeply into the flesh, and at length
become worms, such as are found in our filberts. If it be
taken in time the mischief may be prevented, but if overlooked
too long, it eats the whole toes away. I could write
very much about it.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>From our often-mentioned town of Noster Signora Desumsion
to this village of the Machkasis the distance by land
is three hundred and seventy-two miles.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Now, when we had stayed twenty days in this place of
the Machkasis, we received a letter from a city called
Lieme<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> in Peru, from H. I. M. Supreme Stadthalter there
named Presende or Licentiat de Cascha,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> who had caused
Consaillo Pisere<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> to be beheaded, besides other noblemen
whom he caused to be beheaded along with him, or to be
sent to the galleys, because the said Consaillo Pisere would
not be obedient to him the Licentiate de Cascha, but was
rebellious along with the country against H. I. Majesty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_245_245" id="Footnote_245_245" href="#FNanchor_245_245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> Lima.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_246_246" id="Footnote_246_246" href="#FNanchor_246_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> El Presidente Licenciado La Gasca.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_247_247" id="Footnote_247_247" href="#FNanchor_247_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> Gonzalo Pizarro.</p>
</div>

<p>So it often happens that someone makes more, or takes
more power than has been delegated to him from his
master; and so it is in this world. I certainly think that
H. I. Majesty would have granted the said Pisere his life,
if H. I. Majesty had himself arrested him. He was vexed
that another lord had been placed in authority over his
own land, for this country of Peru, before God and man was
legitimately Consaillo Pisere&rsquo;s, because he, along with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-&nbsp;75&nbsp;-</a></span>
brethren Margossen and Ernando Piseron,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> had discovered
and conquered it first of all. This land is rightly called the
Rich Country, for all riches appertaining to H. I. Majesty
come from Peru, Nova Hispania, and Terra firma.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>But envy and hatred are so great in the world that one
man wishes nothing good to another. And so it happened
to poor Consaillo Pisero, who formerly had been a King,
and afterwards had his head taken off. God be merciful to
him. Much could be written about this, but I have no time
for it.</p>

<p>Now, the above-mentioned letter was to the effect that, in
name of H. I. Majesty, our Commander, Martin Domingo
Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> should not, by any means whatever, depart from
there, but should remain among the Machkasis, and wait
for further orders.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_249_249" id="Footnote_249_249" href="#FNanchor_249_249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> Domingo Martinez de Irala.</p>
</div>

<p>But it was really intended to this effect, that the governor,
fearing that we might excite a rebellion against him in the
country, and associate ourselves with those who had escaped
and taken to flight into the forest and mountain (and that
would doubtless have happened if we had met together again
and we would have chased the governor out of the country),
entered into an agreement with our commander, and made
him a great present, in order to satisfy him and to get off
alive. We soldiers knew nothing about this compact; had
we known of it we would have tied our commander hand
and foot together, and so transported him to Peru.</p>

<p>After this our commander sent four companions to Peru,
whose names were Nueste de Schaieses, Ungnade, Michael
de Ruete, Abaije de Korchua.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> These four persons came to
Peru in one month and a half.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_250_250" id="Footnote_250_250" href="#FNanchor_250_250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> The real names of those officers were: Nuflo de Chaves, Agustin
de Ocampo, Miguel de Rutia, and Ruy Garcia.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-&nbsp;76&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Firstly they came to a people called Poduesis,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> then to
another called Ruessken,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> thirdly to Riodellaplata, and
to the principal town called Lieme.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> These four are the
principal and the richest cities in Peru.</p>

</div>

<p>When those four companions came to the first town,
Poduesis in Peru, the two named Michael de Ruete and
Abaije remained there, because of their weakness, as they
had fallen ill on the journey; the two others, Nueste and
Ungnade, rode post to Lieme to the governor. He received
them well and heard from them a report as to how matters
were going on in the country of Riodellaplata; then he
ordered that they should be treated in the best possible way,
and gave them each two thousand ducats.</p>

<p>Then the governor ordered Nueste de Schaieses<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> to write to
his commander that he should remain until further advice
with his people among the Machkasis,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> but he should not
take from them anything nor do them any harm, excepting
with regard to food, although we knew very well that they
had silver, but being the subjects of a Spaniard, we should
not do them any injury.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>But this post of the governor was waylaid by a Spaniard
named Parnawuie, by order of our commander, who feared
that another commander might come from Peru to rule over
his people; and indeed another one had already been appointed.
Therefore our commander sent out on the roads the
said Parnawuie and ordered him, if there were any letters, to
bring them with him to where he was staying with the
Carios; and this was accordingly done.</p>

<p>Our commander had arranged so badly that owing to the
scarcity of victual we could not remain any longer among the
Machkasis, for we had only enough provisions to last for
one month. If we had only known that we were going to
have both victual and a governor, we would not have removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-&nbsp;77&nbsp;-</a></span>
from there, and we would have found food and ways and
means to remain; but there is nothing but knavery in this
world. Afterwards we went back again to the Karchkockios.</p>

<p>I should also have mentioned that the country of the
Machkasis is so fertile that I have never seen the like of
it before. For if an Indian goes forth into the forest, and
makes a hole with an hatchet in the first tree he comes across,
five or six measures of honey flow out of it, as pure as our
mead. The bees that make this honey are very small and
do not sting.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Their honey may be eaten with bread, or in
any other manner. Good wine is also prepared from it, like
the mead here in Germany, and even better.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_256_256" id="Footnote_256_256" href="#FNanchor_256_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> This description is greatly exaggerated. The bees make their
hives (called in Guaran&iacute; <i>camoati</i>) on the branches of the trees, and it
is from the hive, of course, not from the tree, that the honey is taken.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, when we came to the said Karchkockios, these
Indians had all fled away with wives and children, and were
afraid of us, but it would have been better for them to have
remained in their villages; for our commander soon sent other
Indians after them, and bade them return, saying that they
ought not to fear, that no harm would be done to them; they
would not, however, take heed of our request, but invited
us to leave their village, threatening in case of our refusal to
drive us out of it by force.</p>

<p>Having heard this, we soon made our preparations and
went out against them. However, some of us were of
opinion to send a message to our commander and advise him
not to march against them, because this might bring about a
great want in the land; in case we had to move from Peru
to Riodellaplata, for then we would have no provisions. But
our commander and the whole community would not accept
that proposal, but preferred the above-mentioned advice, and
went out against the said Karchkockios. And when we
arrived at the distance of half-a-mile from them, we found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-&nbsp;78&nbsp;-</a></span>
they had pitched their camp between two hills covered with
forest; so that, if we conquered them, they might the
more easily escape us. But it did not befall them well,
for those we reached had to die at our hands or to become
our slaves. We enslaved in this skirmish over one thousand,
without reckoning those men, women, and children that were
killed.</p>

<p>Afterwards we remained two months in this village, which
was as great as five or six others joined together. We then
went on further, to the place where we left the two aforesaid
mentioned ships, and we were one year and a half on the
journey, always engaged in one war after another, and took
prisoners more than twelve thousand persons, all of whom
became our slaves. I had for my share about fifty men,
women, and children.</p>

<p>And when we came to the ships, the people that had been
left on these bergentines informed us how, during our
absence, a commander, Diego Abriego of Sievilla,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> in Spain,
on the one side, and a commander, J. Francisco Manchossa,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
who had been left in charge of the two ships by our chief
commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> during his absence
on the other side, had begun a great quarrel. They told us
that Diego de Abriego claimed to rule over them, while
Johann Franciscus Manchossa, in his capacity as appointed
commander and substitute of Martin Domingo Eijolla,
would not consent to let him do this; and so the beggars-dance
began between them, until at last Diego de Abriego<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
won the victory, and even took off the head of Johann
Francisco Manchossa. From that moment he made much
noise in the country, and proposed to march against us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-&nbsp;79&nbsp;-</a></span>
First, he fortified himself in the town, and when we came
along with our commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla, before
the said town, he refused to let our commander in, or to surrender
the town, or even still less to recognise him as his
master.</p>

</div>

<p>Our commander having heard this, we beleaguered the
town Noster Signora Desumsion. But the soldiers who
were in that town, seeing that we meant business, came day
after day to us in the open field, and prayed our commander
for mercy. Diego de Abriego, having noticed that he could
not trust his people, and fearing that we might enter the town
by night through treason, which would have certainly happened,
took counsel with his best companions and friends, and
asked who would go out of the town along with him. About
fifty men went out with him; the others came to our commander,
as soon as Diego de Abriego had left, and surrendered,
and begged for mercy. The commander promised them mercy,
and entered the town. But the said Diego de Abriego fled
with the fifty Christians thirty miles away, so that we could
do them no harm. In this way these two commanders made
war one against the other for two full years; so much so,
that one was never sure of the other, for Diego de Abriego
never remained long in the same place, being here to-day, there
to-morrow; and where he was able to do us harm, he
did it, for he resembled very much a highway robber&mdash;in
short, in order to have peace, our commander was compelled
to come to terms with him, and arranged a marriage with
his two daughters, whom he gave to two cousins of Diego de
Abriego, the one of whom was named Albernunzo Richkell,
and the other Franciscus Fergere,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and when this marriage
was arranged we had peace at last.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_261_261" id="Footnote_261_261" href="#FNanchor_261_261"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> The names of these two Spaniards, according to Ruy Diaz de
Guzman, author of <i>La Argentina</i> (1612), and grandson of Irala, were
Alonso Riquelme de Guzman (father of Ruy Diaz), and Francisco
Ortiz de Vergara. There were four marriages, and not two, as Schmidt
says. The other two Spaniards were Gonzalo de Mendoza and Pedro
Segura. Irala&rsquo;s daughters were by Indian women, his captives.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-&nbsp;80&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time I received a letter from Sievilla in
Spain, from the agent of Fugger, named Christoff Keyser,
to say that Sebastian Neidhart had written to him by order
of my late brother, Thomas <a id="Schmidt"></a>Schmidt, asking if there was no
possibility of my returning to Spain. That was what the
said Christoff Keyser had constantly solicited, and caused
this letter to be sent to me, in the year 1552, on the second
day of July, or St. Jacob&rsquo;s day.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<i>Introduction</i> for some explanations about the Fuggers, Neidhart, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Having read this letter, I immediately requested our commander,
Martin Domingo Eijolla, to grant me leave of absence.
At first he refused to concede it to me; but at length he
was obliged to take into consideration my long services, how I
had faithfully served on land H. I. Majesty, having oftentimes
offered my life for him (Martin Domingo Eijolla), and had
never abandoned him. He considered all this, and gave me
leave, at the same time giving me letters for H. I. Majesty,
informing H. I. Majesty how matters stood in Riodellaplata,
and all that had happened there during that time. These
letters were delivered by me at Sievilla to H. I. Majesty&rsquo;s
councillors, to whom I reported also verbally about the
country.</p>

<p>And having now made all my preparations for the journey,
I took leave of my commander, Martin Domingo Eijolla,
and all my good companions and friends, and took with me
twenty of the Carios Indians, who had to carry all that I
had need of for this long journey (and anyone may judge for
himself how many things one must necessarily have for such
a journey).</p>

<p>Eight days before my departure a man came from Presilia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-&nbsp;81&nbsp;-</a></span><a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
and brought the news that a ship had arrived there from
Lisbon, in Portugal, belonging to the honourable and wise
gentleman, Johann von Hulst, a merchant at Lisbon, and
an agent of Erasmus Schetzen of Anttorff.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Having heard all that he had to say, I set out on my
journey, in the name of God Almighty, in the year 1552, on
the twenty-sixth of December, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day. And I
left Riodellaplata<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> from the town Noster Signora desumsion
with twenty Indians in two canoes. We firstly came,
after twenty-six miles distance, to a place called Jubericha
Sabaija<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>; in that place four other companions joined themselves
to me&mdash;two Spaniards and two Portuguese, but they
were without grant of leave from the commander.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_265_265" id="Footnote_265_265" href="#FNanchor_265_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> Rio de la Plata was the official name of this country, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Gobernacion

</div>

<p>From there we went off together, and at the end of fifteen
miles came to a place called Gabaretha.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> After this we went
sixteen miles in four days to a place called Bareia,<a name="FNanchor_267_267_2" id="FNanchor_267_267_2" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and from
there in nine days or fifty-four miles we came to a place
called Bareda,<a name="FNanchor_267_267_3" id="FNanchor_267_267_3" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> where we stayed for two days, in search of
victual and canoes, because we had to go up the river
Paranaw<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> for a distance of one thousand miles; and then we
came to a place called Gienugia,<a name="FNanchor_267_267_4" id="FNanchor_267_267_4" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> where we remained four
days. As far as this place the country belongs to H. I.
Majesty, and is peopled by the Carios.</p>

</div>

<p>Beyond it begins the territory of the King of Portugal, or
the land of the Tapis.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> We had now to leave the Paranaw, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-&nbsp;82&nbsp;-</a></span>
our canoes, and walk to the Tapis; for six weeks we traversed
deserts, mountains, and valleys, and could not sleep for fear
of the wild beasts. From the said place, Gienugia, to these
Tapis the distance is one hundred and twenty-six miles.
This nation of Tapis eat their enemies, have no other occupation
but waging war, and when they have conquered their
enemies, they bring them to their place as prisoners, with
great solemnity, as they do here in Germany at the time of
a marriage. And when they prepare to slaughter their captives
they make a great ceremony. They give their prisoner
all he wishes for or lusts after: women with whom he may
have intercourse, and meals to his heart&rsquo;s content, up to the
hour that he has to die. Their delight and joy consist in
making war. They drink and eat enormously, are full day
and night; they are also fond of dancing, and lead such an
Epicurean life that it is not possible to describe it. It
is a fierce, ambitious, and arrogant people; they make
wine of Turkish corn, becoming as drunk upon it as if they
were drinking the best of wines. They speak the same
language as the Carios, with only a very slight difference.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_269_269" id="Footnote_269_269" href="#FNanchor_269_269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> <i>Tapis</i>, writes here Schmidt, and this is the Guaran&iacute; name of the
tribes south of Brazil, as was given by Father Anchieta and others
contemporary to the conquest. The true spelling is Tapii. Afterwards
this word was corrupted into Tupi, or Tupin, and Tape.</p>
</div>

<p>Next we came to a place called Karieseba, where the inhabitants
are also Tapis; these wage war against the Christians,
whereas those we have spoken of are friends with them.</p>

<p>So we came, on Palm Sunday, at four miles distance from
a place, where I became aware that we had to be on our guard
against those of Karieseba, for we were by this time in great
want of victual. We had, however, intended to go somewhat
farther for victual&rsquo;s sake, but we could not withhold two of
our companions, who, despite our warnings, entered the
place. We promised them to wait, and did so; but before
they could enter the place they were killed and afterwards
eaten. God have mercy on them. Amen.</p>

<p>Then these same Indians came as near as thirty paces from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-&nbsp;83&nbsp;-</a></span>
us, along with fifty men. They wore the clothes of the
Christians, and they stood still and began parleying with us.
Among these Indians, if anyone stands still at a few paces
distance from his enemy and talks to him, he has usually
nothing very good in his mind.</p>

<p>Seeing this, we put ourselves on our defence as well as we
could, and asked of them what had become of our companions.
They told us they were in their town, and invited
us also to enter it. But we would not do so, for we perfectly
well understood their malice.</p>

<p>Then they shot at us with their bows, but they resisted
not long, and soon fled away to their town, whence they
came out again with six hundred men against us. We had
no other protection than a great wood, our four guns, and the
sixty<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Indians of the Carios who had come with us from
Noster Signora desumsion. Nevertheless, we defended ourselves
four days and four nights, always shooting one at
another, and in the fourth night we secretly left the wood
and went off, because we had not much to eat, and our
enemies had become too strong for us, as the saying goes:
Many dogs cause the death of the hare.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_270_270" id="Footnote_270_270" href="#FNanchor_270_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> Schmidt speaks of <i>twenty</i>, not <i>sixty</i>, men with whom he set out.</p>
</div>

<p>Thence we travelled six days through wild forests, more
lonely than any I had ever seen, and I may say that I
have travelled far and wide. We had nothing to eat, and
had to satisfy ourselves with roots and honey that we found
here and there. We could not even afford the necessary time
to hunt for game, so fearful were we that the enemy might
overtake us by night.</p>

<p>At length we came to a nation called Bijessija,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> where we
remained four days and took victual, but we dared not enter
the place because we were so few.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_271_271" id="Footnote_271_271" href="#FNanchor_271_271"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> Mbia&ccedil;ai, the land opposite the island of Santa Catalina.</p>
</div>

<p>In this country there is a river called Urquaie,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-&nbsp;84&nbsp;-</a></span>
we have seen snakes which are called in Spanish Schue Eiiba
Thuescha.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> They are fourteen paces in length and two
fathoms thick in the middle of the body. They do great
harm, to wit, when a man takes a bath or an animal drinks
in a river or would swim across it, such a snake, swimming
under water, comes to the man or animal, puts its tail around
them under water and there eats them. That animal has
always its head above water, in order to watch around for
man or beast.</p>

by Schmidt must be the Boa, which lives near the watering-places
waiting for its prey.</p>
</div>

<p>From there we went for a whole month further a distance
of one hundred miles, and came to a place called Schelebethueba,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
where we remained three days, for we were exceedingly
tired and had no longer anything to eat, our
principal food being honey. We were all consequently very
weak, and everyone can imagine what dreadfully poor and
miserable lives we passed in such a journey, especially as
regards eating and drinking and sleeping. The bed which
every one of us took with him weighed four or five pounds;
it was of cotton, and made like a net. It is tied to two trees,
and one man lies down in it. This is done in the forest,
under the blue sky; for if there are not many Christians
travelling overland together in India, it is better and safer
to remain in the forest than to enter the houses and villages
of the Indians.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_274_274" id="Footnote_274_274" href="#FNanchor_274_274"><span class="label">[274]</span></a> No place of this name in all Brazil.</p>
</div>

<p>We next came to a place which belongs to the Christians,
whose chief was called Johann Reinmelle.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Fortunately for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-&nbsp;85&nbsp;-</a></span>
us he was not at home, for this place certainly appeared
to me to be a robbers&rsquo; haunt. The said chief was at this
time gone to another Christian at Vicenda<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> in order
to make an agreement. Both are (with eight hundred
Christians living in the two villages) subjects of the
King of Portugal, and the aforesaid Johann Reinmelle has,
according to his own account, lived, ruled, made war,
and conquered in India for a period of four hundred
(forty) years. Therefore, he may legitimately claim to rule
the land for another. And because the Portuguese will not
recognise his authority, they wage war. This said Reinmelle
can, in one single day, gather around him five thousand
Indians, whereas the king is not able to bring two thousand
together, so much power and consideration has he got in the
country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_275_275" id="Footnote_275_275" href="#FNanchor_275_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> Juan Ramallo. This man was an exiled outlaw, left probably by
Juan Diaz de Solis and Vicente Ya&ntilde;ez Pinzon on the first voyage of
discovery, which was made as far as 40&deg; S., in 1508. Many travellers
of that time met Ramallo on the coast of San Vicente, living there as
a cacique with a large tribe of his children. The travellers called him
the <i>bachiller</i>. Hans Staden speaks of two of his sons, calling them
Diego de Praga and Domingo de Praga, because Staden made mistakes
in all names of persons and places, just as Schmidt did. The
translators of his book into Latin interpret Ramallo&rsquo;s name as
Reinuelle, and M. Ternaux Compans makes it French, and spells it
Reinvielle. Ramallo&rsquo;s family was the founder of Piratininga, the
origin of the city of San Paulo, in Brazil.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_276_276" id="Footnote_276_276" href="#FNanchor_276_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> San Vicente, on the coast of the province of San Paulo. It was
founded in 1531 by Martin Affonzo de Souza, and was the first Portuguese
colony in Brazil.</p>
</div>

<p>When we came to the village, the son of the said Reinmelle
was there, and he received us very well, though we had to
look closer after him than after the Indians. But all went
well, and no harm happened to us; therefore we thank
God, the eternal Creator, through Jesus Christ, His only Son,
who helped us so mercifully there and everywhere.</p>

<p>We then went farther to a little town called S. Vicenda
at twenty miles distance, where we arrived on July<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> 13th,
1553, St. Anthony&rsquo;s day, and found there a Portuguese ship
laden with sugar, Brazilian wood and wool, belonging to
Erasmus Schetzen. His factor is at Lisbon, and is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-&nbsp;86&nbsp;-</a></span>
Johann von Hulsen, and he has another factor in Vicenda
whose name is Peter R&ouml;ssel.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_277_277" id="Footnote_277_277" href="#FNanchor_277_277"><span class="label">[277]</span></a> June.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_278_278" id="Footnote_278_278" href="#FNanchor_278_278"><span class="label">[278]</span></a> Peter Rossel, or R&ouml;sel, is mentioned by Hans Staden; cf. <i>The
Captivity of Hans Staden</i> (Hakl. Soc.), p. 169.</p>
</div>

<p>Messrs. Schetzen and Johann von Hulsen own a good
number of villages and sugar factories in that place, where
sugar is made all the year round.</p>

<p>Peter R&ouml;ssel received me very friendly, and showed me
great honour. He introduced me also to the sailors, in
order that I might be well treated and leave with the first,
and recommended me to them. To their honour be it said,
they followed his recommendation. We remained eleven
more days in the town of Vicenda in order to prepare
and to provide ourselves with all necessaries that are wanted
at sea. And we were six months travelling a distance of
four hundred and seventy-six miles, from the town Signora
desumsion to the town of Vicenda, in Brazil.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when we were ready, we set forth on our
journey from the town of St. Vicenda on the 24th day of
June, St. John&rsquo;s Day, 1553. We were fourteen days at
sea, because we had never any good wind, but always storms
and tempests, so that we did not know where we were. Then
the main-top got broken, and, water pouring into the ship,
we had to return to land, and came to a seaport named
Spiritu Sanctu,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> situated in Brazil, in India, and belonging to
the King of Portugal. There are Christians living in that
town with their wives and children, and they make sugar.
They also have cotton-wool and Brazilian wood, besides other
kinds of wood that are found there.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_279_279" id="Footnote_279_279" href="#FNanchor_279_279"><span class="label">[279]</span></a> Espiritu Santo, a small maritime province with a bay and port of
the same name, north of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
</div>

<p>Between S. Vicenda and Spiritu Sancto there are plenty
of whales, which do great harm; for instance, when small
ships sail from one port to another (these small ships are
anyhow somewhat larger than the greatest ships at home),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-&nbsp;87&nbsp;-</a></span>
these whales come forward in troops and fight one another,
then they drown the ship, taking it down along with the men.</p>

<p>These whales constantly spit water out of their mouth,
as much at one time as a Frankish barrel would contain.
This the whale does every time that he puts his head under
water and comes up again, by day and by night, and he who
never saw one before believes that he sees a heap of stones.
Much more might be written about this fish. There are
many other rare fish and sea wonders of which one could
not write too much, but I really cannot speak of all.</p>

<p>There is another great fish, called in Spanish <i>Sumere</i>, and
in German straw-fish, of which one cannot say too much.
It is such a powerful fish that it does considerable harm to
ships in various parts. When there is no wind, and the
ships are compelled to lie still, not being able to go forward
or backward, then this fish comes with such a tremendous
blow on the ships, that all things tremble; when this
happens, one has to throw one or two barrels into the
sea; then the fishes go to these barrels, play with them, and
leave the ships.</p>

<p>Another great fish, called the <i>Peischo Spaide</i>,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and in
German knife-fish, does a great deal of harm to the other
fishes, and when these fishes battle against each other, it is
exactly as if two horses ran full tilt together here on
land. This is very amusing to watch at sea. But after
these fishes thus struggle with one another, a great storm
generally follows.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>So there is also another great and bad fish which takes the
mastery over all the others of which I have been speaking,
in struggling and battling. Its name is <i>Pesche de serre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and
in German saw-fish; further, there are a great number more,
but I cannot give their names. There are also flying fishes
and other great fishes called <i>Toningen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-&nbsp;88&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>We sailed for four months together on the sea, without
seeing any land at all, and we conveyed goods from the
aforesaid Spiritu Sancto. Afterwards we came to an island
called Teste de Terzero,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> where we again took fresh victual
and remained there for two days. This island belongs to the
King of Portugal.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_283_283" id="Footnote_283_283" href="#FNanchor_283_283"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> Terceira, one of the Azores.</p>
</div>

<p>From there we sailed to Lisbon in fourteen days, arriving
on the 30th September 1553, St. Hieronymus&rsquo; day, and
remained fourteen days in the town, where two Indians
whom I had taken with me died.</p>

<p>Thence I posted to Seville in six days; the distance being
seventy-two miles. I remained there four weeks till the
ships were prepared, when I left Seville by water, and in
two days arrived at the town of S. Lucas,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> where I passed
the night.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_284_284" id="Footnote_284_284" href="#FNanchor_284_284"><span class="label">[284]</span></a> San Lucar.</p>
</div>

<p>From there I travelled one day by land and arrived at a
town called Porta Sancto Maria,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and from there a second
day also by land to another town, four miles over the water,
called Kalles,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> where there were twenty-five Dutch ships
ready to sail to the Netherlands; all great ships called
<i>Hulcken</i>.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_285_285" id="Footnote_285_285" href="#FNanchor_285_285"><span class="label">[285]</span></a> Puerto de Santa Maria.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_286_286" id="Footnote_286_286" href="#FNanchor_286_286"><span class="label">[286]</span></a> Cadiz.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_287_287" id="Footnote_287_287" href="#FNanchor_287_287"><span class="label">[287]</span></a> Large merchantmen. The word &ldquo;hulk&rdquo; expresses a different
meaning, nearer the original, derived from the Greek <a title="holkas">ὅλκας</a>, a ship
which is towed, from <a title="helkein">ἕλκειν</a>, to draw, drag. Hence the sense of something
bulky or unwieldy.</p>
</div>

<p>One of these twenty-five ships was a beautiful newly
built vessel, which had only made one voyage from
Antorff<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> to Spain; the merchants advised me to sail
with that ship, of which the captain was named Heinrich
Schetz. He was an honest and religious man, with whom I
now came to terms as to the payment for the voyage and
the victual and other things necessary on sea. I finally
agreed with him and provisioned myself during the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-&nbsp;89&nbsp;-</a></span>
night, and had my plunder, bread, and several other things,
as well as the parrots which I brought from India, all
put on board. And, lastly, I arranged with him that he
should tell me the time of departure, which he faithfully
promised me, and that he would not sail without me, but
would certainly let me know.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_288_288" id="Footnote_288_288" href="#FNanchor_288_288"><span class="label">[288]</span></a> Antwerp.</p>
</div>

<p>However, the said skipper that very night drank somewhat
too much, so that he forgot all about me and left
me alone in the lodgings. Two hours before daylight the
steersman, who had the command of the ship, had the
anchor lifted and sailed away, and in the morning when I
looked out for the ship it was already a mile off. So I had
to see after another and make terms with its skipper, to
whom I had to give as much as to the former.</p>

<p>Then we soon sailed away along with the other twenty-four
ships and had a fairly good wind the first three days,
but afterwards we had a contrary wind, so much so that
we were unable to continue our voyage. We remained in
great danger for five days and hoped for better weather, but
the longer we hoped, the more violent became the sea, so we
had to return to where we came from.</p>

<p>Now it is the custom at sea for the mariners and skippers
to elect for themselves a chief commander, called in
Spanish <i>Almiranda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> This commander directs all the ships,
and all his orders have to be obeyed. The mariners and
skippers have to swear an oath to the effect that they
will not separate from one another, for H. I. Majesty had
ordered that no less than twenty ships should sail from
Spain to the Netherlands, because there was war between
H. I. Majesty and the King of France.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_289_289" id="Footnote_289_289" href="#FNanchor_289_289"><span class="label">[289]</span></a> The Spanish word is Almirante.</p>
</div>

<p>Further, it is also usual at sea that one ship should not
separate from another for more than the distance of one mile,
and at sunrise and sunset that the ships should all come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-&nbsp;90&nbsp;-</a></span>
together, and salute the admiral with three or four shots,
and this must be done twice a day.</p>

<p>The admiral is bound to have on the stern of his ship
two iron lanterns, called <i>farol</i>,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> which are alight all night
through, and the others have to follow the ship that shows
this light, and must not separate from each other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_290_290" id="Footnote_290_290" href="#FNanchor_290_290"><span class="label">[290]</span></a> &ldquo;Farol&rdquo; is a Spanish word, meaning a box or case with sides
of glass or some other transparent substance, for placing a light
in, so that it may not be extinguished by the wind.</p>
</div>

<p>So also the admiral tells the others every night whither
he is sailing, in order that if a storm should blow up, they
may know what direction or what wind the admiral has
taken, and not lose each other.</p>

<p>When we had to put back to port, as I have said, there
was the ship of Heinrich Schetzen (whereon all my plunder
was, he who had forgotten me altogether at Kalles<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>) behind
all the other ships; and when we had come within one
mile of Kalles it was dark and night, and the admiral had to
light his lanterns, in order that the ships might follow him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_291_291" id="Footnote_291_291" href="#FNanchor_291_291"><span class="label">[291]</span></a> Cadiz.</p>
</div>

<p>When we reached Kalles each skipper laid out his anchor
in the sea, and the admiral removed his lanterns.</p>

<p>Then a fire was lit on shore with the best intention, but
it was the cause of disaster to Heinrich Schetzen and his
ship. The fire was made near a mill within gunshot of Kalles,
and Schetzen sailed straight towards it, believing it to be
the admiral&rsquo;s light, and when he had nearly reached it, he
struck upon the rocks which stood there in the sea and
had his ship shivered into a hundred thousand pieces, and
in half a quarter of an hour men and goods had all perished.
Twenty-two persons were drowned, only the steersman and
skipper escaping death on a thick tree. Six trunks with
gold and silver belonging to H. I. Majesty, and a large
quantity of merchandise belonging to the merchants, were
also lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-&nbsp;91&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore I say to God be everlasting praise and thanks,
because He has once again guided and protected me so mercifully,
that I did not go on board that ship.</p>

<p>We afterwards remained for two days at Kalles, and
departed thence on S. Andrea&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> day for Antorff.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> On this
voyage we had very bad weather and dreadful tempests, so
that the mariners said that for twenty years, or for so long
a time as they had been at sea, they had never seen such
heavy storms nor heard of any storms that had lasted so long.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_292_292" id="Footnote_292_292" href="#FNanchor_292_292"><span class="label">[292]</span></a> St. Andrew&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_293_293" id="Footnote_293_293" href="#FNanchor_293_293"><span class="label">[293]</span></a> Antwerp.</p>
</div>

<p>When we came to England, into a port called Wydt,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
all our yards and top-sails had been carried away. And if
this voyage had lasted a little longer, not one of the twenty-four
ships would have escaped, but for the special providence
of our Lord God.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_294_294" id="Footnote_294_294" href="#FNanchor_294_294"><span class="label">[294]</span></a> Isle of Wight.</p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1554, and on the Holy
Three Kings&rsquo; Day, eight ships were miserably wrecked with
men and goods&mdash;an awful sight indeed, for every man on
board was drowned.</p>

<p>This happened between France and England. God Almighty
be merciful to them all and to us, through Christ
His eternal Son. Amen.</p>

<p>We remained four days in that port Wydt in England,
and from there we sailed for Brabant, and came in four
days to Armuia,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> which is a town in Seeland,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> where the
great ships lie. It is seventy-four miles from Wydt, and
from there we sailed to Antorff, which is twenty-four miles
off, and arrived there on January the 26th, 1554.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">SINCE</span> it pleased God to deliver Alvar
Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca from captivity,
and from the troubles that he underwent
for ten years in Florida,
he came to these kingdoms in the
year of our Lord 1537, where he
remained till the year 1540; in which
year there came to this court of His Majesty some persons
from the river La Plata to inform His Majesty of what had
happened to the army which Don Pedro de Mendoza had
taken there, and of the danger those were in who had survived,
and to supplicate that His Majesty would be pleased
to aid and succour them before they perished (as but few of
them remained). And when His Majesty knew of it, he
ordered that a certain arrangement and capitulation should
be made with Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, in order that
he might go to their relief. This arrangement and capitulation
was there effected, the said Cabeza de Vaca offering to
go to their assistance, and undertaking to expend for that
journey and relief, in horses, arms, apparel and provisions, as
well as other things, eight thousand ducats. And in consideration
of this treaty thus entered into, His Majesty favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-&nbsp;96&nbsp;-</a></span>
him with the governorship and general captaincy of that land
and province, and with the title of Adelantado.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> It pleased also
His Majesty to grant to him the twelfth part of everything
that was in that land and province, and of all that entered
and went out of it, provided that the aforesaid Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez
expended on that expedition the sum of eight thousand
ducats as aforesaid. And so, in fulfilment of the agreement
entered into with His Majesty, he started immediately for
Seville in order to put the agreement into execution, and
to make provision for the aforesaid assistance and armament.
And to this effect he bought two vessels and a caravel,
together with another that was in waiting for him at
Canaria. One of these vessels was newly arrived from her
first voyage and was of three hundred and fifty tons burden,
and the other was of one hundred and fifty tons. He
equipped these vessels very well and supplied them with
plenty of commodities, and engaged pilots and sailors, and
four hundred soldiers well trained to the use of arms, and
such as were wanted for that relief; and all that volunteered
for that expedition were provided with a double set of arms.
In order to complete his purchases and supplies he remained
there from the month of May till the end of September,
when the ships were ready to sail. But the weather being
unfavourable, he was detained in the city of Cadiz from the
end of September till the 2nd of November, on which day
he set sail and made his voyage, and in nine days arrived at
the island of La Palma, where he disembarked with all his
people, and remained there twenty-five days, waiting for a
favourable wind to continue his voyage. At the end of this
time he sailed towards Cape Verde. In this voyage the ship,
the <i>Capitana</i>, made so much water that it rose to the
height of ten spans in the hold of the vessel. Five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-&nbsp;97&nbsp;-</a></span>
quintals of biscuits were damaged, and much oil was lost,
besides other commodities. This accident caused them great
trouble, and they kept at the pumps day and night till they
arrived at the island of St. Iago (one of the Cape Verde
Islands). Here they disembarked and landed the horses, in
order that they might refresh themselves and rest from their
fatigues, and because it was necessary to unload the vessel
in order to stop the leak. And after she had been unloaded
the master stopped the leak (for he was the best
diver in Spain). They sailed from La Palma to Cape
Verde in ten days, for they are 300 leagues apart. In this
island the harbour is very bad because of the many sharp,
sunken rocks that fray the cables attached to the anchors,
and when they pull on them in order to raise the anchors
these remain in the rocks. And for this reason the sailors
have a saying that there are many rats in that harbour,
which gnaw the cables asunder; and because of this, it is a
very dangerous harbour for vessels stationed there in the
event of a storm. This island is unhealthy and full of infections
in the winter, so much so that the greater part of those
who go ashore there die in a few days, soon after their arrival.
The armada, however, remained there twenty-five days,
during which not a single man died; and the inhabitants
were much astonished at this, and took it as a great marvel.
And the inhabitants gave them a good reception; and this
island is very rich, and there are more doubloons in it than
reales,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> for those who traffic there for negroes were giving a
doubloon for twenty reales.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> we had repaired the leak of the
<i>Admiral</i> ship, and purchased the
necessary supplies, such as water,
meat, and other things, we embarked
and pursued our voyage and crossed
the equinoctial line, and, continuing
our navigation, the master took stock of the water that
was on board the <i>Admiral</i>, and, out of a hundred barrels
that had been stored, he found no more than three left,
and four hundred men and thirty horses had to drink.
And the governor, having seen the necessity we were in,
ordered the ship to land; and they were in search of it
three days, and the fourth day, one hour before dawn, a
wonderful thing happened, and as it is not beyond our
purpose, I will relate it. It happened, as the vessels were
going towards land, they were on the point of striking some
very high rocks, and nobody would have seen or been aware
of them had not a cock began to crow which one of the
soldiers had put on board at Cadiz, being desirous of
listening to the music of the cock; during two months and
a half, however, we had neither heard it nor known of its
existence; and the soldier was grieved at its silence. That
morning, however, the bird felt the land and began to crow,
and its music woke all the people on the vessel, who saw the
rocks an arrow-flight off, and shouted to let go the anchors,
as we were drifting towards the rocks. And so they lowered
the anchors, and this saved us, for had not the cock crowed
our four hundred men and thirty horses would assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-&nbsp;99&nbsp;-</a></span>
have been drowned; and we all thought it a miracle of God
for us. And while we navigated more than one hundred
leagues along the coast, the cock gave us his music every
night, and so the armada arrived at an harbour which is
called Cananea,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> which lies beyond Cape Frio,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and is twenty-four
degrees of elevation. It is a good harbour, and there
are several islands at its entrance. The water is clear and
eleven fathoms deep. Here the governor took possession in
the name of His Majesty, and having done so, he left that
harbour and passed over the river and the bay called San
Francisco,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> which is twenty-five leagues from Cananea, and
thence the armada proceeded to the island of Santa Catalina,
which is twenty-five leagues from the Rio de San Francisco,
and they anchored at the island of Santa Catalina,
after encountering many troubles and reverses on the
voyage, arriving there on the 29th of March 1541. The
island of Santa Catalina is barely in the twenty-eighth degree
of latitude.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> the governor had arrived with
his army at the island of Santa Catalina,
he ordered the disembarkation
of all the people that he had brought
with him, and the twenty-six horses,
being all that had survived the sea
voyage of the forty-six taken on board in Spain, in order
that they might all recover on land from the hardships
they had undergone in their long sea voyage, and that
he might take command and inform himself of the native
Indians of that land who might, perhaps, know how the
Spaniards whom he had come to succour were circumstanced
in the province of Rio de la Plata. And he gave the
Indians to understand that he was sent by His Majesty
to bring help, and he took possession of the land in the
name and on behalf of His Majesty, and also of the
harbour called Cananea, which is on the coast of Brazil,
in twenty-five degrees, more or less. This harbour is fifty
leagues from the island of Santa Catalina, and during all
the time that the governor remained in that island he
treated all the Indians, natives of that and other parts of
the coast of Brazil (vassals of His Majesty) with great kindness.
By these Indians he was informed that at fourteen
leagues from the island, at the place called Mbia&ccedil;a<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> there
were two Franciscan monks, named Friar Bernardo, a native
of Cordova, and Friar Alonzo Lebron, a native of Gran Canaria;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-&nbsp;101&nbsp;-</a></span>
and in a few days these monks came to where the
governor and his people were, in great fear of the Indians,
who sought to kill them, because certain of the dwellings of
the Indians having been burned, these had in revenge
killed two Christians living in that land. And the governor,
well informed of all that had happened, did his best
to appease the Indians, and gave refuge to the monks,
and established peace among them; and he charged the
monks to teach the Christian doctrine to the Indians of that
land and island.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AND</span> the governor, in furtherance of his
expedition to succour the Spaniards,
in the month of May 1541, sent a
caravel with Philip de Caceres, accountant
of His Majesty, with orders
to enter the river La Plata, and visit
the colony founded there by Don Pedro
de Mendoza, and called Buenos Ayres. And because the
season of the year was winter, and the weather unfavourable
to navigation, he was unable to enter that river, and
returned to the island of San Catalina, where the governor
was.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> And about this time there arrived nine Spanish
Christians, who came in a boat, having fled from the colony
of Buenos Ayres because of the ill-treatment used towards
them by the captains residing in the province; and from
these Spaniards he obtained information of the state in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-&nbsp;102&nbsp;-</a></span>
which the Spaniards were who lived in that country. They
told him that the colony of Buenos Ayres was inhabited and
provided with people and commodities; and how Juan de
Ayolas, whom Don Pedro de Mendoza had sent on an expedition
of discovery into the interior, while returning from his
discovery, and intending to take refuge in certain brigantines
which he had left in the harbour, named by him Candelaria,
in the river Paraguai, had been killed by a certain nation of
Indians living on the same river, called Payagu&aacute;s<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>; and all the
Christians, with many other Indians whom he had brought
with him from the interior of the country to carry the loads,
belonging to the tribe of Chameses, were also slain; and
that of all the Christians and Indians only one boy of the
Chameses had escaped; and all this had happened because
he (Juan de Ayolas) had not found in the said harbour of
Candelaria the brigantines which he had left to be guarded
till his return, according to the orders he had given a certain
Domingo de Irala of the province of Biscay in Spain, whom
he had left in the capacity of captain; who, before the
return of Juan de Ayolas, had withdrawn and abandoned
the harbour of Candelaria, so that Juan de Ayolas, not
finding the brigantines as he had expected, had fallen a
victim to the Indians, who had stripped and slain all his
party because of the fault of the said Domingo de Irala, the
Biscayan captain of the brigantines. They also told him
that on the shore of the river Paraguai, one hundred and
twenty leagues below the harbour of Candelaria, a colony
had been formed which was called the town of Ascension,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
having a good understanding and friendship with a tribe of
Indians called Carios, and that most of the Spaniards in that
province resided there. They further informed him that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-&nbsp;103&nbsp;-</a></span>
colony and harbour of Buenos Ayres, situated on the rio del
Parana, there were seventy Christians, and the distance from
that harbour to the city of the Ascension, on the Paraguai,
was three hundred and fifty leagues, of very difficult navigation,
up the river. Here, in the capacity of <i>locum tenens</i>
of the governor of the land and province, resided Domingo
de Irala of Biscay, through whose fault happened the death
of Juan de Ayolas, and all the Christians whom he had
brought with him. They also told him that Domingo de
Irala had gone from the town of the Ascension up the river
Paraguai with certain brigantines and people, saying that he
was going to search out and relieve Juan de Ayolas, and had
entered a land, much troubled with rains and marshes, and
because of this he had been unable to explore that land, and
had returned with six Indian captives of the same tribe of
Payagu&aacute;s as those who had killed Juan de Ayolas and the
Christians. From these prisoners he had obtained information
and sure knowledge of the death of Juan de Ayolas and
of the Christians, as well as from an Indian of the tribe of
Chameses, named Gonzalo, who had escaped when his tribesmen
and the Christians, whose loads they were carrying,
were slain; who had lived ten years in captivity among
those Payagu&aacute;s. And Domingo de Irala had withdrawn
from that country, having lost sixty men from sickness and
fatigue. And they also told him that the officials of His
Majesty, residing in that land and province, had done and
were doing great wrongs to the Spaniards, colonists and
conquerors, and to the Indian natives, vassals of His
Majesty, and that there was much dissatisfaction and disgust.
For this reason, and also because of the ill-treatment they
had suffered from these captains, they had stolen a boat from
the harbour of Buenos Ayres, and had taken to flight
with the intention and determination to inform His Majesty
of all that had passed in that land and province. To
those nine Christians, who came naked, the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-&nbsp;104&nbsp;-</a></span>
gave clothing, and took them under his protection in order
to bring them back with him to the province, for they were
useful men, good sailors, and one of them was a pilot who
knew the navigation of the river.</p>

<h4>How the governor hastened his journey.</h4>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> listened to the statement of
those nine Christians, the governor
thought that, in order to succour as
speedily as possible the Spaniards
residing in the town of the Ascension,
as well as those in the port of Buenos
Ayres, he would discover a road by
<i>terra firma</i> from the island, and so make his way to those
parts already mentioned where the Christians were, and that
he would send the vessels round by sea to Buenos Ayres.
He therefore, against the will and opinion of the accountant
Philip de Caceres, and of the pilot Antonio Lopez, who
advised that they should all go together to Buenos Ayres,
sent from the island of St. Catalina, Pedro Dorantes (the
factor) to explore a road by land into the interior of the
country where formerly many vassals of the King of Portugal
had been killed by the native Indians. This Pedro Dorantes,
by order of the governor, started with one hundred Spaniards,
and some Indians who acted as guides; and at the end of
three months and a half he returned to the island of St.
Catalina, where the governor was awaiting him, and this,
among other things, was what he reported: having crossed
great sierras, and mountains, and much desert country, he
had arrived at a place called &ldquo;el Campo&rdquo; (the plain), where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-&nbsp;105&nbsp;-</a></span>
the country began to be inhabited, and that the natives of
the island had told him that the route he had taken was the
safest to enter that country. He had followed a river called
the Ytabuc&uacute;,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> which is opposite the point of the island at
eighteen or twenty leagues from the harbour. When the
governor knew of this, he sent immediately to reconnoitre
the country watered by this river, through which he decided
to make his journey; and having done this, he determined
to enter the country by that route, in order to explore a
region that had never before been seen, and carry relief, in
the shortest possible time, to the Spaniards in that province.
Having thus decided upon his plans, he told the friars,
Bernardo de Armenta and Alonzo Lebron his companion,
to remain in the island of St. Catalina and instruct the
native Indians in the Christian doctrine, directing and confirming
those already baptized. But these monks declined
to obey, assigning as a pretext that they wished to accompany
the governor<!--was governer-->, in order to establish themselves in the
town of the Ascension, where the Spaniards were whom he
was going to relieve.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor, having full information
concerning those parts through which
he had to enter in order to discover
the land and relieve the Spaniards,
and being supplied with all things
necessary for his journey, on the
eighteenth of October of the same year ordered the embarkation
of the people that were to follow him in the
discovery, with the twenty-six horses and mares which
had survived the sea voyage; and he ordered them to
cross the river Ytabucu and subdue it, and take possession
of it in the name of His Majesty, as newly discovered
land. He left in the island of St. Catalina one
hundred and forty persons, who were to embark and go by
sea to the river La Plata, where the port of Buenos Ayres is
situated; and he charged Pedro <a id="Estopinan"></a>Estopi&ntilde;an Cabeza de Vaca,
whom he left there in the capacity of captain of the said
people, that before leaving the island he should supply and
furnish the vessel with provisions both for the people he was
taking with him, as well as for those in Buenos Ayres; and
before his departure he gave many presents to the natives of
the island, in order that they might remain, and some of
them readily offered their services to accompany the governor
and his people, to show the road and be useful in other
ways; and their assistance happened to be very handy. On
the 2nd November of the said year the governor ordered
that all his people, besides the provisions carried by the
Indians, should each take what he could carry for the road.
And the same day he began his march, with two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-&nbsp;107&nbsp;-</a></span>
and fifty arquebusiers and crossbowmen, very well trained in
arms, twenty-five horses, the two Franciscan friars, and the
Indians of the island; then he sent the vessel back to the
island of St. Catalina in order that Pedro de <a id="Estopinan2"></a>Estopi&ntilde;an
Cabeza de Vaca might embark and go with his people to
Buenos Ayres; and so the governor went on his way into
the interior of the land, where he and his people underwent
many troubles. In nineteen days they crossed great mountains,
cutting roads through forests, to enable the men and
the horses to pass, for all the land was uninhabited. And at
the end of these nineteen days, having exhausted the provisions
which they had carried when they began their
march, and having nothing left to eat, it pleased God that,
without the loss of a man, they discovered the first inhabitants,
who are called &ldquo;del campo&rdquo;, where they found certain
villages of Indians, whose chief lord was called A&ntilde;iriri, and
at one day&rsquo;s journey from this people there was another
whose chief was Cipoyay. And beyond this people again
there was a third tribe of Indians, whose chief said that he
was called Tocanguas&uacute;. And when the Indians knew of
the arrival of the governor and his people, they went out to
meet him laden with plenty of provisions, showing great joy
at their arrival. The governor received them affably, and,
besides paying the value of the provisions into the hands of
the chiefs, he graciously gave them many shirts and other
things, with which they remained satisfied. This is a people
and tribe called Guaran&iacute;s; they are cultivators, sowing
maize twice in the year, and also cassava. They rear fowls
as in our Spain, and geese; keep many parrots in their
houses, and occupy much land, and the whole are of one
language. They eat human flesh, as well that of their
Indian enemies as of Christians; they also eat one another.
This people is very fond of war, and they seek it; they are
very vindictive. Of this people and their territory the
governor took possession, in the name of His Majesty, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-&nbsp;108&nbsp;-</a></span>
newly discovered land, and called it the province of Vera,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
as it appears from the deeds of possession that were drafted
before Juan de Aroaz, notary royal. And this being done on
the 29th of November, the governor and his people left
Tocanguasu. And after two days&rsquo; march, on the 1st of
December, they arrived at a river called by the Indians
Yguazu,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> which means big water; here the pilots took the

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">FROM</span> this river Yguazu the governor
and his people advanced on their discovery;
and on the 3rd of December
they arrived at a river called by the
Indians Tibagi.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Its bed is paved with
large stones, placed in such order and
regularity as though by hand. In crossing to the other side of
this river there was great trouble, because the people and the
horses slipped on the stones and could not keep their footing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-&nbsp;109&nbsp;-</a></span>
and to remedy this they joined hands. And although the river
was not very deep, the water ran with great force. At about
two leagues beyond this crossing the Indians came with great
delight, and brought the army provisions, so that they were
never short of food, and had sometimes even more than they
could take, and left it on the road. This caused the governor
to give the Indians much, and to be generous with them,
especially with their chief, to whom, besides paying the price
of the commodities which they brought, he gave many
presents, and did them many favours and treated them so
well that the fame went through the land and the province,
and all the natives laid aside their fear and came to see and
to bring all they had, and they were paid for it as aforesaid.
The same day, being near another Indian settlement, whose
chief said he was called Tapapiraz&uacute;, there arrived a newly
converted native Indian whose name was Miguel, who came
from the town of the Ascension, where the Spaniards resided
who were to be relieved. This Indian was returning to the
coast of Brazil, as he had been a long time with the Spaniards.
The governor conversed for some time with him, and informed
himself of the condition in which were the province, the
Spaniards and the natives, and of the great danger in which
the Spaniards were because of the death of Juan de Ayolas,
and of other captains and people killed by the Indians.
Having given full information, this Indian, of his own wish,
offered to return in company with the governor to the town
of the Ascension, whence he had come, to guide and show
the Spaniards the road they had to take. Then the governor
discharged the Indians that came with him from the island
of St. Catalina, and ordered them to return. These Indians,
owing to the good treatment and many presents they had
received, returned well satisfied and merry. As the people
that the governor brought with him were wanting in experience,
and for fear lest they should do wrong or mischief to
the Indians, he ordered that they should neither traffic nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-&nbsp;110&nbsp;-</a></span>
communicate with them, nor visit their houses and villages,
for the Indians are of so easily excitable a nature, and shocked
at the least thing, that great inconvenience might have resulted
in all the land. He therefore ordered that only those
persons who understood the Indians should have dealings
with them, and buy the provisions for all the people at the
governor&rsquo;s cost. And so every day he distributed the provisions
himself, and gave them gratis without any interest.
It was curious to see how feared were the horses by the
Indians of that land and province, that for the terror they
had of them they dropped on the road, and set food for
them, such as fowls and honey, saying that, provided they
would not be angry, they would give them plenty to eat;
and to tranquillize them they said that they would not
abandon their settlements. But fearing lest the Christians
should use violence with them they fixed their camps at
some distance off. Owing to the good order that was
kept, and seeing that the governor punished everyone who
offended them, all the Indians, with their wives and children,
had such confidence that it was a sight to see. And from
very distant parts they came, laden with provisions, only to
see the Christians and their horses, as a thing that had never
before been seen in the land.</p>

<p>The governor and his people, continuing their journey
through the land and province, arrived at a settlement of
Indians of the tribe of Guaran&iacute;s, and the chief of this tribe
went out with all his people in great joy to receive and
welcome him. And they brought with them honey, geese,
fowls, flour, and maize. And the governor, through the
medium of interpreters, spoke to them affably, and told them
he was pleased at their coming, and ordered that they should
be paid for what they brought, which gave them great satisfaction.
Moreover, he sent as a present to the chief of this
tribe, whose name was Pupebaie, some presents, such as
knives and scissors and other articles. We left the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-&nbsp;111&nbsp;-</a></span>
of this tribe so merry and pleased that they danced and sang
for joy all through the settlement.</p>

<p>On the seventh of December they arrived at a river
known to the Indians as the Taquari.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> This river has a
copious stream and a strong current; and they found its
banks inhabited by a tribe of Indians whose chief was called
Abangobi. This chief, in company with all the Indians of
his tribe, together with their wives and children, came out
to receive the governor, showing great joy at his arrival; and
they brought plenty of provisions, for which they were paid
as usual. All these Indians belong to one tribe, and all
speak one language. From this place they went on, leaving
the natives so well satisfied that they carried the news from
place to place of the good treatment used towards them, and
showed everything they had received, so that wherever the
governor and his people had to pass, the natives were friendly
and came to meet them laden with provisions, receiving
payment according to their satisfaction. On the 14th December,
having passed through some tribes of Guaran&iacute;s, by
whom he was well received and entertained, the governor
and his people arrived at a settlement whose chief said he
was called Tocangusir. Here they halted one day to rest,
because the people were tired; and the direction they were
following was west north-west a quarter north. And at
this place the pilots observed for latitude in twenty-four
and a half degrees, at a distance of one degree from the
tropic. Since entering the inhabited region they had found
the country to be very pleasant, with large plains, forests,
and many rivers, streams and rivulets, with abundance of
good drinking water. In fact, it is a land very suitable for
cultivation and stock-rearing.</p>

of that land.</h4>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">FROM</span> the place called Tuguy, the governor
and his people continued
their journey to the 19th December,
without finding any settlements; this
circumstance, and the many rivers
and bad passages that had to be
crossed by men and horses, caused them much trouble.
They had to make as many as eighteen bridges in a single
day, across rivers as well as over marshes, many of which
were dangerous; and they had to pass great sierras and
steep mountains and large thickets of reeds that had
hard, sharp points, and other jungle. Twenty men had
to be constantly in advance, cutting and clearing a road; and
it took many days to pass through these forests, which were
so thick that the sky could not be seen overhead. And on
the said nineteenth day of the said month they arrived at a
certain settlement of Guaran&iacute;s, who with their chief, their
wives and children, showing great pleasure, came forth to
meet the Spaniards, two leagues from their settlement,
bearing many commodities, such as fowls, geese, honey,
potatoes and other fruits, maize, and flour of the pine tree,
of which they make great quantity.</p>

<p>There are many pine trees in that land so great that four
men with their hands joined cannot compass one. They are
tall and straight, and very suitable for masts of ships and
caracks, according to their length. Their fruit is large, and
the kernel about the size of an acorn. The husk is like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-&nbsp;113&nbsp;-</a></span>
of chesnuts, yet they differ in flavour from those of Spain.
The Indians gather them, and make of them a great quantity
of flour for their nourishment. There are many wild
boar and monkeys in that country, which feed on those kernels
in the following way: the monkeys climb to the tops of
the pine trees, and suspend themselves by their tails; then
with hands and feet they detach a number of these fruits and
let them fall to the ground. And when they have thrown
down a quantity of these fruits they descend and eat them;
but it often happens that the wild beasts are watching while
the monkeys pull down the fruit, and when they have thrown
them down, while the monkeys are descending from the pine
trees, the boars come out against them; and they steal and
eat the fruit, the monkeys all the while uttering cries from
the branches of the trees. There are also other fruits, of
different kinds and taste, that ripen twice a year. In this
place of Tuguy the governor remained during the feast of
the nativity, both to celebrate this feast as well as to rest
the people. They found here an abundance of provisions,
for the Indians supplied them with all commodities. So
the Spaniards, partly owing to the festivities, and partly to
the good treatment they received from the Indians, were
much refreshed, although such repose was very prejudicial
to them, because, taking no exercise and eating plentifully,
they could not digest what they ate, and they immediately
caught fevers, which did not happen while they were
marching. As soon as they resumed their march, after the
first two days they got rid of the disease, and regained their
health. At first the people importuned the governor, entreating
that he might stop and rest some days, but he
would not consent to it, for he had already experienced
what would be the consequence; but the people thought
that he declined because he wished to give them more
trouble, till at length they were fain to acknowledge he
had so acted for their good, since by eating much they
suffered; and of this the governor had great experience.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> twenty-eighth day of December the
governor and his people departed from
the village of Tuguy, where they left
the Indians well pleased, and, pursuing
their route by land the whole
day without finding any inhabitants,
they came to a wide and deep river with a strong
current, and along it were forests of cypress and cedar,
and other trees; in crossing this river they had plenty
of trouble that and the three following days. Marching
through the land, they passed by five villages of the
Guaran&iacute; Indians, all of whom came forward and greeted us,
with their wives and children, bringing plenty of provisions,
so that our people were always well supplied, and the Indians
very pacific, owing to the good treatment and the payment
they received. All this is a very pleasant land, abounding
in water and woods. The inhabitants sow maize, cassava
and other seeds, and three kinds of potatoes, white, yellow,
and reddish, very large and well flavoured. They rear geese
and fowls, and gather much honey from the hollows of the
trees.</p>

<p>The first of January of the year <span class="smfont">A.D.</span> 1542, the governor
and his people left the Indian settlements, and advanced
across a mountainous region, through dense thickets of reeds,
where our people underwent much trouble, because, up to
the fifth of the month, they met with no settlement, and
had to suffer much from hunger; and they kept themselves
alive with great difficulty, besides having to open roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-&nbsp;115&nbsp;-</a></span>
through the reed jungle. In the hollows of these reeds
there were some white worms,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> about the length and thickness
of a finger; the people fried these for food, obtaining
sufficient fat from them to fry them in very well; all ate of
them, and thought it excellent food. And from the hollows
of other reeds they collected good drinking water, and were
much comforted by it. They used to search for these worms
during their march, in order that they might have enough to
eat, and so provide for their necessities and hunger in their
journey through that inhospitable region. They crossed,
with great difficulty, two wide and very deep rivers, flowing
towards the north; and the following day, being the sixth
of January, after marching through uninhabited country,
they encamped for the night on the bank of another deep
river, with a very strong current and with plenty of reed
thickets, where the people gathered the worms and subsisted
upon them. So they pursued their journey, and the
next day they passed through a very good region, well
watered and abounding in game, such as boar and deer, and
they killed some and divided it among the people. That day
they crossed two small rivers, and it pleased God that none
of the Christians fell sick, and everybody kept on marching
in good condition, cheered by the hope that they would soon
reach the town of the Ascension, and the Spaniards whom
they were going to relieve. From the sixth to the tenth of
January they passed many Indian Guaran&iacute; settlements, all
of whom received them peacefully, and greeted them joyfully;
the inhabitants of each village, with their chief,
accompanied by their wives and children, came laden with
provisions, from which the Spaniards derived great help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-&nbsp;116&nbsp;-</a></span>
But the monks Bernardo de Armenia and Alonzo his companion
went in advance to collect provisions; and when the
governor and his people arrived, it happened that the
Indians had nothing more to give; and the people complained
to the governor of this, as they had oftentimes done
before, and he warned the monks not to do so, and not
to take along with them certain Indians, of all ages, who
were of no use, and to whom they gave food; but the monks
declined to obey. Then all the people were ill-disposed
towards them; but the governor favoured them, as they were
engaged in the service of God and His Majesty. At length
the monks separated themselves from the people, and, against
the will of the governor, took another road. He directed
that they should be brought back from the Indian settlements,
where they had taken refuge; and had he not so
ordered their withdrawal, they would have come to grief.
The tenth of January, continuing their march, they passed
many rivers and rivulets, and other bad passages, great
sierras and mountains, and thickets of reeds abounding with
water; every sierra<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> having a fertile valley and a river,
besides other streams and forests. In all this land there is
plenty of water, because it is under the tropic, and the
direction of their route on these days was west.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> fourteenth of January, continuing
their journey among settlements of
Indians of the nation of Guaran&iacute;s, all
of whom came to meet the Spaniards
with much pleasure, bringing maize,
fowls, honey, and many other commodities;
and as the governor always paid them to their
contentment, they brought such a profusion that the
surplus remained on the road. All their people go naked,
men as well as women; they had a great fear of the
horses, and asked the governor to tell the horses not to
be angry with them; and in order to appease them they
brought them food. So they arrived at a wide river of
mighty waters called Yguat&uacute;,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> a very noble river, abounding
in fish and bordered by forests; on its shore there is a settlement
of Guaran&iacute;s, who sow maize and cassava, as in other
parts they had already passed through; and they came out
to receive the governor, being aware of his coming, and of
the good treatment they would receive; and they brought
plenty of provisions. In all that land there are pine trees of
many different kinds, with fruits like those I have spoken of.
And the Indians waited upon the governor and his people,
because he always treated them well. The Yguat&uacute; flows due
west in the twenty-fifth degree, and may be as large as
the Guadalquivir. Its banks (according to the accounts of the
natives, and as I saw with my own eyes) are populous, and
the inhabitants are the richest people of all that land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-&nbsp;118&nbsp;-</a></span>
province, both for agriculture and stock-raising. They rear
plenty of fowls, geese, and other birds; and they have
abundance of game, such as boar, deer, <i>dantas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> partridges,
quails, and pheasants; and they have great fisheries in this
river. They grow plenty of maize, potatoes, cassava, <i>mandubies</i>,
and many other fruits; and from the trees they
collect a great quantity of honey. From this settlement the
governor decided to write to the officials of His Majesty, and
to the captains and people residing in the town of the Ascension,
to let them know that by order of His Majesty he was
on the way to relieve them, and sent two native Indians of
that land with the letter. While staying on the river
Pequiry,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> a dog bit a certain Francisco Orejon, citizen of
Avila in Spain, in the leg; and fourteen other Spaniards fell
sick because of the long journey. These remained with
Orejon, in order to follow by short stages. The governor
recommended them to the natives, in order that these might
favour them, and guide them on the way to follow him when
they recovered their health. And in order that they might
do this the more willingly, he gave many presents to the
chief and other natives, who were much pleased with them.
All this country, through which the governor was marching
with his people making his discoveries, is filled with large
fields abundantly watered by rivers, rivulets, and springs,
well shaded by trees and cultivated. It is the most fertile
land in the world, adapted for cultivation and colonization.
Many parts of it are conveniently situated for sugar refineries;
and the country is full of game. The inhabitants
are of the nation of the Guaran&iacute;s, who eat human flesh, and
are all agriculturists and rear geese and fowls. They are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-&nbsp;119&nbsp;-</a></span>
domesticated people, friendly towards the Christians, and
with a little trouble would accept our holy Catholic faith, as
experience has proved. And, judging from the nature of the
soil, it is certain that if there are mines of silver anywhere,
it is here they may be found.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor having left the Indians of
the Pequiry very friendly and peaceful,
continued his journey with his people
through the interior, passing many
settlements of Guaran&iacute;s, all of whom
came to meet him with plenty of
provisions, showing great joy at his coming. And to
all their chiefs he distributed presents, and even the
old women and children came to greet them, laden with
maize and potatoes. And the inhabitants of villages which
were one and even two days off along his line of march
did the same, and all brought commodities; and for some
distance before the villages were reached they cleared and
swept the road, dancing and making great merriment on
seeing the Spaniards. What increases their pleasure and
contentment is to see their old women merry, because they
are wont to do as these tell them, and are more obedient to
them than to the old men. The last day of January, continuing
to advance into the interior of the province, they
arrived at the river Yguaz&uacute;, and before arriving at this river
they traversed an uninhabited region without finding any
settlement of Indians. This is the same river they crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-&nbsp;120&nbsp;-</a></span>
at the beginning of their journey, when they left the coast
of Brazil. It is also called in that part Yguaz&uacute;. It flows
from east to west, and there are no settlements on its banks.
Here they took the altitude and found it to be twenty-five
and a half degrees. Before arriving at the river Yguaz&uacute;,
they learned from the natives that it fell into the Paran&aacute;,
also called Rio de la Plata; and that between this river
Paran&aacute; and the Yguaz&uacute; the Indians killed the Portuguese
whom Martin Alfonzo de Sosa<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> had sent to discover that land,
who were slaughtered while crossing the river in canoes.
Some of these Indians who had so killed the Portuguese
warned the governor that the Indians of the Pequiry river
were bad people and our enemies, and that they were lying
in wait to seize and kill us during our passage of the river.
Because of this the governor held a council, and decided to
secure both banks of the river, he with part of his people
descending the Yguaz&uacute; in canoes, and entering the Paran&aacute;,
while the remainder of the people with the horses went by
land, and took up a position on the bank in order to overawe
the Indians; all the people were then to pass to the other
side in the canoes, and this was accordingly effected. The
governor himself with eighty men embarked in canoes and
descended the Yguaz&uacute;, the remainder of the people and the
horses proceeded by land, as we have said, and all joined on
the river Paran&aacute;. The current of the Yguaz&uacute; was so strong
that the canoes were carried furiously down the river, for near
this spot there is a considerable fall, and the noise made by
the water leaping down some high rocks into a chasm may be
heard a great distance off, and the spray rises two spears
high and more above the fall.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> It was necessary, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-&nbsp;121&nbsp;-</a></span>
to take the canoes out of the water and carry them by hand
past the cataract for half a league with great labour. Having
left that bad passage behind, they launched their canoes and
continued their voyage down to the confluence of this river
with the Paran&aacute;. And it pleased God that the people and
the horses that went by land, as well as those in the canoes
with the governor, all arrived at one time. On the bank of
the Paran&aacute; there had assembled a great number of Indian
Guaran&iacute;s, all decked with parrots&rsquo; feathers, painted red and
a variety of other colours, holding their bows and arrows and
all massed together for battle. The arrival of the governor
and his people in the manner we have described caused
much fear among them and threw them into confusion. We
began to speak with them through interpreters and to distribute
a number of presents among their chiefs; and as they
were covetous people, delighting in novelties, they began to
be appeased and to approach us. And many of them helped
us to cross to the opposite bank.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> When we had passed,
the governor ordered rafts to be made by lashing the canoes
by twos together; and in two hours they were ready, all the
people and the horses reaching the other side without being
interfered with by the natives. This river Paran&aacute;, at the
place where we crossed it, was a long cross-bow shot wide,
very deep and rapid; in passing it one of the canoes upset
and one Christian was drowned, the current having drawn
him under, and he never rose to the surface. The strength
of the current and great depth form many whirlpools.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> the governor had passed the river
Paran&aacute; he was greatly disappointed
at not finding the two brigantines
which he had ordered by letter the
two captains who were at the Ascension
to send, these vessels being much
needed to protect the passage for the transport of the sick and
those who were fatigued with the long journey. As there were
many incapable of marching who could not safely be left
behind in the midst of so many enemies, who might soon
pluck up courage to attempt some of their treasonable practices,
he arranged to send the sick down the Paran&aacute; on the
rafts, entrusting them to the care of an Indian chief named
Yguaron, to whom he gave presents. This man offered to take
charge of the sick in person and bring them to the village
of Francisco, a servant of Gonzalo de Acosta, in the expectation
that by the way they would meet the brigantines, and
would be received and entertained by them; meanwhile
this Indian, Francisco, who had been brought up among
Christians and who lived on the bank of the Paran&aacute;, four
days&rsquo; journey from the point of their departure, according to
the information of the natives, would look after them. So
the governor ordered them to embark, and they were about
thirty men, and he sent with them fifty arquebusiers and
crossbowmen for their protection. And as soon as he had
sent them, the governor, with the remainder of his people,
continued his journey by land towards the town of the
Ascension, to reach which he would have to travel nine days
according to the information given by the Indians inhabiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-&nbsp;123&nbsp;-</a></span>
the banks of the Paran&aacute;. Possession was taken of this river
in the name of His Majesty, and the pilots took the altitude
and found it to be twenty-four degrees.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The governor and his people advanced across the country,
passing settlements of the Guaran&iacute;s, all of whom received
him well, and came forth to meet him laden with provisions,
as usual. In this march they crossed large marshes, and
other bad places, and rivers, and had to build bridges and
overcome many difficulties. After the passage of the Paran&aacute;
the Indians accompanied them from village to village, showing
great friendship and goodwill; they did them many good
offices, both in serving as guides, and providing them with
food. For all this the governor rewarded them generously,
and made them well satisfied. During the march a Spaniard
came from the town of Ascension to meet the governor,
and took back tidings to his fellow-countrymen, and the
people there, of his arrival; for, owing to the straits they
were in, their desire to see him and his people was very
great; and they could hardly believe that he would do them
such a service until they had seen him with their own eyes,
even though they had read the letters he had written to
them. This Christian informed the governor of the situation,
and of the danger the people were in, of the deaths that had
happened both of those who went with Juan de Ayolas, as
well as many others slain by the natives, and of their great
tribulation and discouragement, especially since the evacuation
of Buenos Ayres; for they had long expected relief from
Spain, and when at length that port was abandoned, they
had given up all hope of deliverance. He also related many
other losses that had been sustained in the country.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> learned of the above-mentioned
Spaniard of the death of Juan de
Ayolas and his companions, and of
the deaths of other Christians, of the
extremity of the survivors in the town
of Ascension, and of the abandonment
of Buenos Ayres, whither he had left orders that the
ship <i>Capitana</i> should proceed with the one hundred and
forty men from the island of St. Catalina; considering,
too, the danger in which those might be who arrived
by sea, when they found that port deserted by the Christians
and in the hands of a large number of Indians,
he made all the haste he could to reach Ascension in the
quickest time possible, in order that he might infuse new
courage into those who remained there, and restore confidence
among the friendly Indians. All the natives of the parts he
was now travelling through make their houses of straw and
wood, and many of those from the district round Ascension
spoke to the governor in our own Castilian tongue, bidding
him and his Spaniards welcome. Their reception of him was
as cordial as any met with heretofore. They cleared and
swept the road, formed processions with their wives and
children, waited his arrival with presents of provisions:
maize, wine, bread, potatoes, fowls, fish, honey, and game, all
prepared; and they distributed these gifts among his men.
In token of peace they raised their hands, and, in their own
language, some, too, in ours, welcomed the governor and his
people. Along the route they entered into conversation
with us, and were as cordial and familiar as though they
were our own countrymen, born and bred in Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-&nbsp;125&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Travelling in this way, it pleased God that on the eleventh
of March, being one Saturday, at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
in the year of grace 1542, we arrived at the city of Ascension,
where we found the Spaniards living whom we had
come to relieve.</p>

<p>This town is situated on the bank of the Paraguay, in
twenty-five degrees south latitude. Before entering it the
governor was met by all the captains and people resident
there, who showed incredible joy at his arrival, declaring
they had never believed, or even expected that they would
be relieved, so great were the dangers and difficulties of the
road never before explored; as for the sea-route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Buenos
Ayres, by which they had hoped succour might have reached
them, their expectations from this quarter had also vanished
since the Indians had taken the aggressive with the idea of
soon capturing and making an end of them. Moreover, so
long a time had elapsed since any Spaniards had landed
there, that they were in despair.</p>

<p>The governor received them all at an interview, spoke very
kindly with them, and informed them that he had come by
His Majesty&rsquo;s orders to succour them. Thereupon he showed
his credentials and powers to Domingo de Irala, and the
officers Alonzo Cabrera, controller, a native of Loja; Philip
de Caceres, accountant, of Madrid; Pedro Dorantes, factor,
of Bejar, and to other captains and inhabitants of that province.
These documents were read out to the clergy and
soldiers present, and by virtue of them they recognized him
as governor, and signified their obedience as to a captain-general
of the province, appointed by His Majesty. The
insignia of justice were given up to him, and were redelivered,
in the name of His Majesty, to the magistrates
who should administer civil and criminal law in the said
province.</p>

Pequiry, arrived at the town of Ascension.</h4>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THIRTY</span> days after the arrival of the
governor at the town of Ascension, as
we have related, the Christians, both
sick and sound, whom he had sent on
rafts from the river Paran&aacute;, arrived at
the harbour, one only being missing;
and he had been killed by a tiger. They reported
to the governor how the Indians of the river assembled
in great numbers with their canoes, and while our men
were descending on the rafts, came out and attacked
them with loud cries and beating of drums, shooting a storm
of arrows at them. Two hundred canoes surrounded them
at one time, trying to board and take possession of the rafts
in order to kill the Spaniards. For fourteen days and nights
they never ceased fighting, being exposed all that time to a
constant fire of arrows, both from those on shore as well as
those in the canoes. The natives tried with long hooks to
seize hold of the rafts, and drag them towards the shore,
while the incessant shouting and cries of these men made so
much din that one would have said the powers of light and
darkness were at war with one another. They gave them no
rest, for those in the canoes changed places with those on
shore, these continuing the fight while the others rested.
Twenty Spaniards were wounded, but not seriously; and all
this time the rafts kept drifting down stream, borne along by a
strong current. They descended so rapidly that rowing was unnecessary,
and all their efforts were directed to prevent their
being drawn to land, where the danger was greatest. Nevertheless,
they were now and then exposed to great peril,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-&nbsp;127&nbsp;-</a></span>
owing to the whirlpools which caught the rafts and twirled
them round; and it required all the skill of those that navigated
them to prevent them being taken inshore by the
eddies. In this way they continued their voyage for fourteen
days without the possibility of finding succour or protection,
always pursued by the Indians in their canoes, and
a constant target for their arrows. At length they arrived
near the village of Francisco, the Indian, who, with some of
his men, came out to meet and succour the Christians. He
brought them to an island near his village, and gave them
food, for they were weary with the fatigues they had undergone,
and starving. Here the wounded recovered from their
wounds, and all rested, for the enemy had not dared to
pursue them farther, and had withdrawn. Meanwhile the
two brigantines sent for their relief arrived at the village.
In these they embarked and arrived at the Ascension.</p>

ship &lsquo;Capitana&rsquo;.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="100" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ALVAR NUNEZ</span> ordered two brigantines
to be equipped with all diligence,
and to be loaded with provisions
and other commodities; and
having manned them with some of
the former colonists of Buenos Ayres
who were acquainted with the navigation
of the Paran&aacute;, he sent them to relieve the one hundred
and forty Spaniards who were to have embarked at St. Catalina
in the ship <i>Capitana</i> for Buenos Ayres; for, owing to the
abandonment of this port, these people would be exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-&nbsp;128&nbsp;-</a></span>
great danger. He ordered that the port should be immediately
rebuilt in the most convenient place, as the colony
was necessary for the safety and welfare of all the Spaniards
in the province, as well for those who might come there in
future, ships being obliged to anchor in this part of the
river; here, too, brigantines have to be built to navigate the
river for three hundred and fifty leagues to the town of
Ascension.</p>

<p>The first two brigantines set out on the sixteenth of April.
After they had started, the governor ordered two more to
be built, and laden with provisions and people, to proceed
also to the relief of the Spaniards, and to re-establish the
port of Buenos Ayres. He gave special injunctions to the
captains of these two vessels to treat the natives of the
Paran&aacute; with kindness, and induce them by fair means to
acknowledge the sovereignty of the King. He, moreover,
directed them to take note of everything that occurred, in
order that a full report might be sent to His Majesty.
Having made these dispositions, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez turned his
attention to the service of God, and His Majesty, and to
the pacification of the province. For the better accomplishment
of these duties, he summoned a meeting of the monks
and clergy residing in that province, as well as those that
had come with him, and, in the presence of all the officers,
the captains and the people, he entreated them, in kind but
earnest words, to bestow special attention to the teaching of
the Christian doctrines to the natives, subject to the King,
and he caused certain passages of the Royal Charter to be
read aloud, in which special mention was made of the treatment
of the Indians. He further enjoined the monks, clergy,
and other ecclesiastics, to take the Indians under their
particular care, and to protect them from ill-treatment, and to
inform him of anything done contrary to these orders&mdash;promising
to supply all things necessary for this holy cause,
and for the celebration of the sacraments in the churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-&nbsp;129&nbsp;-</a></span>
and monasteries. And for this purpose he supplied them
with wine and flour, and distributed among them the vestments
he had brought for use in divine service; and he also
gave them a barrel of wine for this use.</p>

<h4>How the natives kill and eat their enemies.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">SOON</span> after the arrival of the governor
at the Ascension the natives and conquistadores
brought serious charges
against the officers of His Majesty.
Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez therefore ordered all the
native subjects of the king to assemble,
and in the presence of the monks and
clergy told them he had been sent to protect them, and that
they should come to the knowledge of God and accept
Christianity at the hands of the monks and clergy who had
come as the ministers of God, and should subject themselves
to His Majesty. If they did this they would be better
treated and protected. He warned them to give up eating
human flesh, as that was a sin and grave offence in the sight
of God. The monks and the clergy repeated this warning,
and the governor concluded by distributing presents among
them, such as shirts, stuffs, caps, and other things they
delighted in.</p>

<p>These Guaran&iacute;s speak a language common to all the tribes
of this province. They eat the flesh of their enemies whom
they take captive in war, bringing them to their settlements
and making great merriment and rejoicing with them,
dancing and singing till the captive grows fat. They give
him their wives and daughters, in order that he may have
every pleasure. It is these wives who take the trouble to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-&nbsp;130&nbsp;-</a></span>
fatten him. Those held in the greatest honour among
them admit him to their couches, adorn him in various ways
according to their custom, and bedeck him with feathers and
necklaces of white beads and stones, which are much prized
among them. When he begins to grow fat they redouble
their efforts; the dancing, singing, and pleasures of all kinds
increase. Then the men come; they adorn and make ready
three boys of the age of six or seven, placing a little hatchet
in their hands. The Indian considered the bravest among
them now takes a wooden sword in his hand, called in their
language <i>macana</i>, and leads the captive to a place where he
is made to dance for one hour; the Indian then advances,
and with both hands deals him a blow in the loins, and
another on the spine to knock him down. It happens sometimes
that after striking him six blows on the head they cannot
kill him, so hard are their heads, though this two-handed
sword is made of very tough, heavy, black wood, and the
executioner is strong enough to kill an ox with a single blow.
When they have knocked him down the three boys come
with their hatchets, and the eldest of them, usually the son
of the chief, begins striking blows on his head, the others do
the same till the blood flows; the Indians meanwhile
exhorting them to be brave and learn to kill their enemies
and make war upon them, and to remember that this victim
has killed many of their own people, and that they should
revenge themselves upon him. As soon as he is dead the one
that gave him the first blow takes the name of the dead man
and keeps it henceforward in token of his bravery. Then
the old women cut the body in pieces and cook it in their
earthenware pots, distributing the flesh among themselves.
They eat it and consider it excellent food. Afterwards they
resume their dancing and pleasures, which last several days,
saying that now the enemy who had slain their relatives is
dead, they will take their rest and make merry.</p>

<h3><a name="SEVENTEENTH" id="SEVENTEENTH">CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.</a></h3>

<h4>Of the peace which the governor concluded with the Indian
Agazes.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="100" height="110" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the banks of this river Paraguai there
is a nation of Indians named Agazes;
it is a people most feared in all that
country, for besides being valiant they
are well practised in war and very
treacherous. Under pretext of making
a treaty of peace they ravaged other
tribes, not sparing even their own relatives, wishing to make
themselves masters in the land, so that nobody trusts them.
They are men of great size and gigantic limbs; they lead
piratical lives in their canoes on the river, landing to pillage
and capture the Guaran&iacute;s, who are their principal enemies.
They live by fishing and the chase, and do not cultivate the
soil. When they capture the Guaran&iacute;s they tie their hands
together and drag them into the canoes and carry them away.
Then they return to the relatives of their captive, who
come forth and offer to ransom him; and they strike him
cruel blows in the presence of his father, children, or wives,
as the case may be, and demand food, threatening to
slaughter their prisoner if this is not brought. Having
taken as much provisions as their canoes will hold, they
return to their houses, carrying their captive along with
them. And this is their usual practice, for it rarely happens
that the captives are actually ransomed. After they are
tired of keeping them in their canoes and beating them, the
Agazes cut off their heads and hoist these on poles on the
bank of the river. Before the governor&rsquo;s arrival the
Spaniards had made war against these Indians and killed a
number of them; peace had afterwards been concluded, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-&nbsp;132&nbsp;-</a></span>
this had been broken with characteristic perfidy by the
Agazes, who had done much injury to the Guaran&iacute;s and
carried off a quantity of their provisions. A few days
before the governor&rsquo;s arrival at the Ascension the Agazes
had violated the peace, having attacked and ravaged certain
villages of the Guaran&iacute;s, besides keeping the town of
Ascension daily on the alert. When the Agazes knew of
the governor&rsquo;s arrival, their chiefs, named Abacoten, Tabor,
and Alabos, accompanied by a large number of their people,
arrived in their canoes, and presented themselves before him,
saying they wished to swear allegiance to His Majesty, and
to be friendly with the Spaniards; they declared that if they
had not kept the peace hitherto, that was owing to the
audacious conduct of some foolish youths, who had begun
hostilities without their leave, causing it to be supposed that
the chiefs had broken the peace, but that they had been well
punished for it; and they entreated the governor to receive
them into his amity, and make peace between them and the
Spaniards, promising they would keep it. This promise they
repeated in the presence of the monks, clergy, and officials.
Having heard this message, the governor received them
kindly, and replied that he was pleased to receive them as
vassals of His Majesty, and as friends of the Christians, provided
that they would keep the peace, and not break it as
heretofore. He gave them to understand that, should they
misbehave in future, they would be regarded as enemies, and
be made to suffer accordingly. In this way he made peace
between them and the Spaniards. He gave orders in the
meanwhile that they should be well treated and receive provisions.
The conditions of peace were that the said Indians,
the chiefs of the Agazes and others of that nation, should
agree that whenever they descended the Paraguai in canoes
as far as the Ascension, they should not enter upon territory
belonging to the Guaran&iacute;s otherwise than all together, and
never separately, nor by night, but always in the daytime;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">-&nbsp;133&nbsp;-</a></span>
that they should only land on the opposite side of the
river, not on this side, where the Guaran&iacute;s and Spaniards
have their fields and establishments; that they should not
ravage the country and harass the Guaran&iacute;s, and that they
should terminate their war against them, and cease from
troubling them any more, as these people were now vassals
of His Majesty; that they should deliver up certain of their
Guaran&iacute; captives, of both sexes, who had been captured
during the time of peace, because they were Christians, and
their relatives were much distressed at it; that they should
not interfere with the Spaniards and Guaran&iacute;s when they
fished in the river and hunted on the land; and, lastly, that
such of their wives, daughters, and relatives who had been
converted to Christianity should be allowed to persevere in
that holy work, and not be carried away or compelled to
absent themselves. Provided that these conditions were
kept, the Agazes would be treated as friends, but if any
article of the treaty were broken they would be proceeded
against as enemies. These terms having been well explained
and understood by them, they promised to observe them,
and thus was peace restored and their submission brought
about.</p>

arms; and all this at his expense, and
without interest. He then begged the officers of His Majesty
to discontinue vexing and wronging these unfortunate people,
as they had hitherto done, for many complaints had been
made by both <i>conquistadores</i> and <i>pobladores</i>. They tried to
enforce a new tax lately imposed on fisheries, butter, honey,
maize, and other commodities; on the skins with which they
clothed themselves, and which they bought of the Indians;
and this besides the collection of debts due to His Majesty.
The officers urged the governor to allow them to continue
these taxes, but he would not consent to it, and in this
way incurred their animosity. Prompted by a bad spirit
towards him, they strove to do him all the harm they could
by indirect means. He therefore had them arrested and
thrown into prison, in consequence of evidence brought

the vicinity of the Paraguai, near the
town of the Ascension, vassals of His
Majesty, came and presented themselves
before the governor, and complained
of a tribe of Indians that
dwelt near their borders. These Indians are great warriors,
and valiant men, who live on venison, butter, honey,
fish, and wild boar, eating nothing besides, neither they
nor their wives and children. They go daily to the chase
for it is their only occupation. They are nimble and
vigorous, swift of foot, and so long-winded that they tire out
the deer, and catch them with their hands, besides slaying
many more with their arrows, as well as tigers and other
fierce animals. They are kind to their wives, and not only to
those of their own tribe, who are greatly esteemed by them,
but also to women generally; thus, if any fall into their hands
when they are making war, they set them at liberty, and
do them no wrong. They are much feared by all the other
tribes. They never remain more than two days in one place,
but quickly remove their houses, made of matting, to distances
of one or two leagues when they are in pursuit of game. This
tribe, and others that live by fishing, eat of a certain bean<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> that
grows in that country; they search for it in the mountains
where the trees are that produce this fruit; and the wild boar
climb the hills at the same time, and for the same purpose.
It ripens in November and the beginning of December, and
they make flour of it, and wine strong enough to intoxicate
themselves.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> chiefs of the Indians complained to
the governor that the Guaycur&uacute;s had
dispossessed them of their land, and
killed their fathers, brothers and relatives,
and since they were vassals of
His Majesty, they claimed protection
and restitution of their property. They had hunted on
the mountains, they had fished in the lagoons and rivers,
they had collected honey for their own support and that
of the Christians. Moreover, the wrongs and murders
they complained of had taken place since the governor&rsquo;s
arrival in the country. He examined into the complaints
of these chiefs, whose names were Pedro de
Mendoza, Juan de Salazar, Cupirati, Francisco Ruis Mayraru,
Lorenzo Moquirasi, Gonzalo Mayraru, and other newly
converted Christians, in order to satisfy himself of the truth
of their allegations, and to proceed according to law; and he
said that they must bring good evidence of their alleged
wrongs. They then presented as witnesses a large number
of Spanish Christians, who had been present, and seen the
injuries done by the Guaycur&uacute;s; how these people had
driven them from their lands, and laid waste a large
stockaded settlement named Caguaz&uacute;. Having heard this
information, the governor sent for the monks and clergy&mdash;friar
Bernardo de Armenta, and friar Alonzo Lebron, his
companion; the bachelor Martin de Almenza, and Francisco
de Andrada, priests; and commanded them to inquire
into the affair, and report as to whether war could be justly
made against the Guaycur&uacute;s. They wrote their opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-&nbsp;137&nbsp;-</a></span>
and signed it with their names, to the effect that he (the
governor) might, with armed hand, march against the said
Indians, and wage war against them, since they were implacable
enemies. The governor then ordered two Spaniards,
who knew their language, and Martin de Almenza, with an
escort of fifty Spaniards, to go in search of the Guaycur&uacute;s,
and summon them to submit to His Majesty, and desist from
making war against the Guaran&iacute;s, that these might freely go
about their land, and enjoy their chase and fisheries. If
they would do this, he promised to consider them as friends,
but if they refused, he should make war upon them as
mortal enemies. So the ambassadors set out, having been
specially charged to repeat their message and warning two
or three times calmly and deliberately. Eight days afterwards
they returned, and declared that they had warned the
Indians, but that these had taken up arms against them,
saying that they did not choose to obey, or to be friends
with the Spaniards and Guaran&iacute;s, and told them to withdraw
immediately from the land. At the same time they
shot a number of arrows, and wounded many of them. The
governor, having been informed of all that had happened,
ordered two hundred arquebusiers and crossbowmen to be in
readiness, and twelve horsemen, and with these he left the
town of Ascension on Thursday the twelfth of July 1542.</p>

<p>As he had to pass to the other side of the Paraguai, he
bade them make ready two brigantines, to ferry the men and
horses across, and he ordered all to assemble at a certain
village of the Guaran&iacute;s, called Tapu&aacute;,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> on the bank of the
Paraguai. Its chief, Mormosen, is a brave man, much feared
in that country, who had already become a Christian, and
bore the name of Lorenzo. He had been master of Caguaz&uacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-&nbsp;138&nbsp;-</a></span>
when the Guaycur&uacute;s took it. All the soldiers and the
horses marched to Tapu&aacute; by land, a distance of four leagues
from the town of Ascension, passing, on the way, large
troops of the Guaran&iacute;s, who had orders to rendezvous at the
same place, and accompany the governor on his expedition.
It was wonderful to see the order they kept, and their preparations
for war, all of them armed with bows and arrows,
adorned with parrots&rsquo; feathers, and painted with divers
colours. They had musical instruments, which they use in
battle, such as timbals and trumpets, cornets, etc. All
arrived on the same day at Tapu&aacute;, and found here large
numbers of the Guaran&iacute;s, bivouacking under the trees along
the river bank. The chief, Mormosen, and his relatives,
accompanied by a number of the people, advanced to meet
the governor, a bow-shot from the village, and brought with
them a large quantity of venison and ostrich-flesh which
they had killed on that and the previous day, in such plenty
that there was more than sufficient for all the people. The
Indian chiefs then held a council, and decided that it would
be necessary to send out scouts to reconnoitre the country
and position of the enemy, and ascertain if tidings had
reached him of the advance of the Spaniards, and whether
he kept watch at night. This advice was followed, and two
Spaniards, together with Mormosen and other brave Indians
who knew the country, went forward. The following day
being Friday, they returned before nightfall, and reported that
the Guaycur&uacute;s had gone a-hunting in the plains and mountains,
having fired the grass in several places, as is their
wont. Our people had seen them moving their camp, accompanied
by their wives and children, to settle in a new place,
where they might subsist by hunting and fishing, and they
seemed to be unaware of our coming. From our camp to the
place where the Indians had probably fixed their abode
might be five or six leagues, judging from the fires they had
kindled to drive the game.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THAT</span> same Friday the brigantines arrived
for the passage of the river,
and the Indians brought a number of
their canoes. Being now fully informed
as to what should be done,
and having taken counsel with his
captains, the governor arranged that the army should
cross the following morning, Saturday, and proceed in
quest of the Guaycur&uacute;s. He ordered rafts to be made
of the canoes, to convey the horses over, and as soon
as it was daylight the embarkation began in good order, the
soldiers in the brigantines, and the Indians in their canoes.
The zeal displayed by the Spaniards, and the loud cries of
the Indians, were remarkable. From six in the morning to
two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the crossing went on, though
there were two hundred canoes engaged in the passage.</p>

<p>A sad accident happened at this juncture. As the
Spaniards vied with one another who should be first, one
of the vessels was overloaded and capsized, the keel floating
above water with all her living freight clinging to it. They
would certainly all have been drowned, had not a number
of Indians who saw the occurrence from the bank jumped
at once into the water and righted the vessel. But the
current was so strong at this place that two of the Spaniards
were swept down the river, whom it was impossible to
rescue, their bodies being recovered lower down; and their
names were Diego de Ysla, a citizen of Malaga, and Juan de
Valdez, a citizen of Palencia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-&nbsp;140&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>When all the people and the horses had crossed to the
other side, the principal Indians came to the governor, and
told him that it was their invariable custom, whenever they
were about to make war, to give their captain a present,
accordingly they begged him to accept it. The governor,
wishing to humour them consented. Then all the chiefs,
one after the other, brought him a prettily painted bow and
arrow; and all the Indians, one by one, presented a painted
arrow adorned with parrots&rsquo; feathers; and the remainder of
that day was taken up by the presentation of these offerings,
so that it was necessary to pass the night on the bank of
the river, stationing sentries to keep watch.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> Saturday, the governor, with the
advice of his captains and monks,
arranged that before beginning the
march, scouts should be sent in advance
to reconnoitre the movements
of the Guaycur&uacute;s, in order that dispositions
might be made to attack
and drive them from the lands of the Guaran&iacute;s. So the
Indian spies and Christians set forth, and returned at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with the report that the Indians had
been hunting the whole day, and that their wives and children
were in front of them, and that they did not appear to
have any fixed idea of settling anywhere. Upon this being
known, it was decided to march at once, as secretly as possible,
in pursuit of the enemy, observing the precaution of not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-&nbsp;141&nbsp;-</a></span>
lighting fires, and not breaking the ranks for the purpose of
hunting or any other motive, in order not to give the enemy
an inkling of their whereabouts. These dispositions having
been taken, they started in good order, on Sunday morning,
and marched at the foot of the forested slopes of the mountains,
so as to conceal their movements. The Indian scouts, all
picked men and swift of foot, led the advance, returning
every now and again to report what they could discover of
the enemy.</p>

<p>The order of march was as follows: the Indians went
together in a troop extending over a league in length, all
arrayed in parrots&rsquo; feathers, and with bows and arrows. In
front of them was the advanced guard, and behind came
the main body, the governor and the cavalry, followed
by the Spanish infantry, arquebusiers and crossbowmen.
After these came the women, bearing the munitions and
provisions of the Spaniards. The Indians carried their own
supplies. In this order they marched till mid-day, when
they rested under some large trees, where they all halted
and partook of some refreshment. After this, they resumed
the march, led by the Indian guides, along footpaths, where
the quantity of deer and ostriches was amazing. Neither
Indians nor Spaniards, however, ventured to hunt for fear of
discovering themselves to the enemy; but all kept their
ranks, the Guaran&iacute;s in advance numbering some ten thousand
men, all painted and bedizened with necklaces of beads and
plumes, and plates of copper, which glistened marvellously
well in the sun. And many of them had bows, and a great
number of arrows.</p>

Ave Maria,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> a tumult among the Indians.
And a dispute arose in this
wise. A spy came back from the
Guaycur&uacute;s, and brought back word that they were
retiring for fear of the Guaran&iacute;s, and that he had seen
them hunting the whole day; and that their wives and
children were in advance, and he believed they would
settle that evening. The Guaran&iacute;s had been informed,
on the other hand, by some female slaves, whom they had
captured a few days previously of another tribe called Merchireses,
that the report current among that tribe was that
the Guaycur&uacute;s were engaged in war with the Guatatas, and
were about to attack this tribe, and that was why they were
advancing with such haste through the country.</p>

England.</p>
</div>

<p>The scouts continued to follow the enemy closely, in order
to see where he would halt, and give the governor information.
And he, having heard all this from the last spy, and
seeing that it was a fine night, ordered the march to be
continued in the same order as before, a strict watch being
kept, the archers with their crossbows strung, and the arquebusiers
with their arquebuses loaded and fuses lighted, as
the occasion required, for although the Guaran&iacute;s were marching
with us and were our allies, it was prudent to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">-&nbsp;143&nbsp;-</a></span>
every precaution, and place as little confidence in them as
an enemy, for they are wont to be treacherous if too much

<h4>Of a panic among the Spaniards and Indians, caused by
a tiger.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor and his army were marching
through the skirts of a thick
forest, and night was approaching,
when a tiger passed through the midst
of the Indians, causing a great panic
and confusion among them, so that
the Spaniards took to their arms, and, thinking the
Indians were in revolt, fell upon them, calling on Santiago.
In that affray several Indians were wounded,
and their companions, seeing the attack made upon them,
fled to the mountains. The governor himself narrowly
escaped being wounded by two gunshots, the bullets having
grazed the skin of his face; and these shots were certainly
fired maliciously with intent to kill him, and to please
Domingo de Irala, whom he had deprived of the command
of the province.</p>

<p>Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, seeing the Indians had fled, and anxious to
put an end to the disorder, dismounted and rushed into the
forest after them. He called to them that it was nothing
more than a tiger had caused the confusion, that he and his
Spaniards were their friends, and that they were all brothers
and subjects of His Majesty, and that all should advance
together and drive the enemy from the country. The Indians,
seeing the governor in person among them, and hearing all
he said, became appeased, and descended the hill with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-&nbsp;144&nbsp;-</a></span>
It is certain that things were at one time so critical as to endanger
our men, because, if the Indians had fled and returned
to their homes, they would never again have had confidence
in the Spaniards. The governor then summoned the chiefs
by name, and told them to follow him in perfect security,
and have no fear. &ldquo;If the Spaniards were about to kill
you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you were yourselves to blame, for you took
up arms, and made them believe you intended to kill them;
let it be clearly understood that the tiger was the cause of
this panic, and let us all be friends once more. You know
that the war we are about to engage in is in your interest
and on your behalf only, for the Guaycur&uacute;s have never seen
the Spaniards, or had any trouble or grievance with them.
We are proceeding against them to protect and defend you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yielding to the governor&rsquo;s entreaties and encouraging
words, the Guaran&iacute;s returned, and placed themselves under
his orders, though still frightened. They said they had been
thrown into confusion by the fear that the enemy was upon
them, and had fled for protection into the midst of the
Spaniards, and this was the only cause of their fear. When
the chiefs were pacified, all the people came together, without
anyone having been killed. When all were re-united,
the governor ordered that henceforth the Indians should
pass to the rear, and the Spaniards should march in front,
the cavalry being in advance of all, so that the Indians
might see with what goodwill the Spaniards marched against
the enemy, and lay aside any fears they might still have
left; for the Spaniards in that province depended entirely
upon the Indians for their means of subsistence, and without
this would have had to abandon it altogether. So they
marched for two hours after sunset, and halted to sup under
some trees on the provisions they carried with them.</p>

<h4>How the governor and his people overtook the enemy.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="100" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AT</span> eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, when the
Indians and Spaniards were resting,
without light or fire for fear of betraying
their presence to the Guaycur&uacute;s,
one of the spies, who had been
sent to observe the enemy&rsquo;s movements,
came into camp, and reported that he had seen
them setting up their village. The governor was much
pleased on hearing this news, as he had feared that they
might have heard the reports of the firing that had taken
place in the confusion of the night. Having learned from
this spy that the spot they had fixed upon for their settlement
was three leagues off, he gave orders to strike the
camp, and march slowly forward, in order not to arrive
at the place too early, so as to be ready to begin the
attack at daybreak. As a security to the friendly Indians, and
to distinguish them from the enemy, he ordered them all to
paint white crosses on their chests and shoulders, so that the
Spaniards might recognise them as friends, and not kill them
by mistake for Guaycur&uacute;s. Although this precaution was
adopted, it did not avail much in the obscurity of night, when
friend and foe became mixed up in hand to hand fighting, and
the quick blows of the sword could not be arrested.</p>

<p>We marched till break of day, and then reached the
enemy&rsquo;s habitations, waiting till daylight before delivering
the attack. In order that the horses might not, by their
neighing, give the enemy warning, the governor ordered their
mouths to be filled with grass; meanwhile the Indians were
directed to surround the enemy&rsquo;s position, leaving a passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-&nbsp;146&nbsp;-</a></span>
for his escape to the mountains, so that the carnage might
not be too great.</p>

<p>While waiting in expectation, the Guaran&iacute;s were almost
paralysed with fear; nothing would induce them to begin
the attack, notwithstanding the entreaties and persuasion of
the governor. Soon after the drums of the Guaycur&uacute;s were
heard beating to arms, and challenging anybody to come and
fight them, saying they were few in numbers, but more
valiant than any other tribe in the land; that they were
masters of it, and of all the animals contained in it; they
were lords also of the rivers and the fish. These people,
who are accustomed to keep watch every night, a little before
daybreak came forward and threw themselves on the
ground, and in this position saw the host of our army, and
the lighted fuses of the arquebuses. And when they saw
this they cried aloud, &ldquo;Who are you that dare come to our
houses?&rdquo; And a Christian who knew their language answered:
&ldquo;I am Hector (this was his name) and I have come
with my people to barter (the corresponding word in their
language meaning revenge) the death of the Batates<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> whom
you slaughtered.&rdquo; Then they answered, &ldquo;Cursed be your
coming, for you shall be served as they were.&rdquo; Having
thus spoken, they threw the burning logs they held in their
hands at the Spaniards, and then rushed into their huts,
seized their bows and arrows, and attacked our people with
such impetuosity and courage that they appeared to make
no account of them. The Indians who had come with the
governor showed great cowardice, and would have fled had
they dared to do so. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez, seeing this, entrusted the
artillery to Don Diego de Barba; Captain Salazar was placed
in command of the Spanish infantry and Indians, these
latter being in two divisions. He ordered the breastplates
to be put on the horses, and, thus arrayed in order of battle,
our forces charged the enemy with cries of &ldquo;<i>Santiago!</i>&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-&nbsp;147&nbsp;-</a></span>
governor, on horseback, led the van, and cut down all that
opposed him. When the enemy saw the horses for the first
time, a great fear fell upon them, and they fled to the
mountains as quickly as they could. Passing through their
village, they set fire to their houses, and these being made of
mats of rush and grass, caught fire at once, the flames
spreading to the others, about twenty in number, all portable,
and each having a length of five hundred paces. Their
owners, numbering about four thousand warriors, retired
behind the smoke caused by the burning houses, and whilst
so concealed killed two Christians, and decapitated twelve
of our friendly Indians. This operation is performed by the
aid of two or three teeth of a fish called the <i>palometa</i>, which
bites fish-hooks in two. These teeth are attached to a small
stick. The Guaycur&uacute;s, holding their prisoners by the hair
of the head, pass this instrument round their neck, and with
a twist or two of the head, completely sever it from the
body, and carry it off by the hair. They will perform this
operation while they are running, as if it were the easiest
thing possible.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> defeated the Guaycur&uacute;s, the
governor pursued them. As one of
the horsemen was following him, an
Indian of the enemy seized hold of
the mare he was riding by the neck,
and pierced her through and through
with three arrows he held in his hand; nor could they make
him loose his hold of the animal before they had killed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-&nbsp;148&nbsp;-</a></span>
If the governor had not been present at this fight the victory
would have been doubtful.</p>

<p>These Indians are very tall, swift of foot, valiant and
strong. They are Gentiles, having no fixed abode, and subsist
by hunting and fishing. No nation had ever conquered
them before the Spaniards, and their idea is, if anyone should
vanquish them, to serve them as slaves. Their women are
allowed the right of delivering a prisoner who has fallen
into their hands, so that he shall neither be killed nor
enslaved, and if he choose to remain among them, he is
treated as one of their own people. These women have
certainly more liberty than that bestowed on our women in
Spain by Queen Isabella, our Sovereign Lady. The governor
and his people, being tired of pursuing the enemy, returned
to camp, and having assembled his army, began his march
towards Ascension, followed by the Guaycur&uacute;s a great
distance, arms in hand; and the governor had much trouble
to keep his men together, and prevent them being cut down
by those of the enemy who had escaped in the fighting; for
a Guaran&iacute; having possessed himself of a feather, an arrow, or
a mat of the enemy&rsquo;s, will return home alone without taking
the precaution of waiting for his companions. In this way it
happened that one thousand of the Guaran&iacute;s were caught and
killed singly by about twenty Guaycur&uacute;s. Four hundred
prisoners, men, women and children, were made in that expedition.</p>

<p>During the return march the horsemen speared a number
of deer, and the Indians were surprised to see the swiftness
of the horses, which could overtake the deer. They, too,
killed very many with their arrows. At four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon a halt was made under some large trees, and they
passed the night here, having stationed sentinels to keep a
good watch.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> following day, in broad daylight,
they set out in good order, hunting as
they marched, and a number of deer
and ostriches were killed. Some of
the former were even killed by the
Spaniards with their swords, as they fled
from the horsemen and Indians and sought refuge in the ranks
of the infantry. It was a strange and very pleasant sight to
see the chase that day. One hour-and-a-half before nightfall
they arrived on the river Paraguai, where the governor had
left the two brigantines and the canoes. And that day they
began passing the men and horses over to the other side, and
continued this the following day from morn till midday, by
which time all had been ferried across, and the governor and
his people marched on to the town of Ascension, where he had
left a garrison of two hundred and fifty men, under the orders
of Gonzalo de Mendoza. This captain had made prisoners six
Indians of the tribe of Yapir&uacute;s,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> who are tall and valiant
men, good warriors and runners. They neither cultivate the
land nor rear animals, but live exclusively by the chase and
fishing; they are enemies of the Guaran&iacute;s and Guaycur&uacute;s.
Gonzalo de Mendoza informed the governor that these
Indians had arrived the previous day, having crossed the
Paraguai; and had said that their tribesmen had heard of the
war waged against the Guaycur&uacute;s, and that they and all the
other tribes were dismayed on hearing of this, and that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-&nbsp;150&nbsp;-</a></span>
chief had sent them to make it known that they wished
to be friendly with the Christians, and to offer their help,
should it be wanted, against the Guaycur&uacute;s. Gonzalo de
Mendoza had suspected treachery in all this, and that their
real object was to spy out the place; he had therefore
detained them prisoners till he could satisfy himself of their
sincerity of purpose. The governor ordered them to be
brought at once before him, and having sent for a Spanish
interpreter who knew their language, questioned them separately
as to the objects of their coming. Having seen that
it would be to the advantage of His Majesty&rsquo;s service, he
treated them kindly, and gave them many presents for them
and their chief, promising he would receive them into his
amity as subjects of His Majesty, and would protect and
defend them, provided that they desisted from making war
on the Guaran&iacute;s, who were vassals of His Majesty, and that
this had been the cause of the war he had made against the
Guaycur&uacute;s; then he dismissed them, well satisfied.</p>

that the tribe of Agazes with whom a
peace had been made, that very night
on which he had started on his campaign
against the Guaycur&uacute;s, had come
armed to set fire to the town, and make war upon the
Spaniards. These Indians, however, had been seen by the
sentries, who had sounded the alarm. Perceiving that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-&nbsp;151&nbsp;-</a></span>
were discovered, they had then taken to flight, and made a
raid upon the cultivated land and establishments of the
Spaniards, from whom they had taken a number of Guaran&iacute;
women newly converted to Christianity. Since then they had
come every night to maraud and pillage the land, causing much
injury to the natives, and had thus broken the peace. The
women of their own tribe, whom they had given as hostages
for their good behaviour, had that same night of their arrival
escaped, and were believed to have informed their people
that the town was short of defenders, and that now was the
time to kill the Christians. Following the advice of these
women they had begun the war, and, as they are wont to do,
had laid waste the dwellings of the Spaniards, where they
kept their provisions, and had carried away upwards of
thirty Guaran&iacute; women. The governor caused an inquiry to
be made into this, and convoked the monks, clergy, officers
and captains, whom he informed of the acts of the Agazes,
and how they had broken faith, ordering them in the name
of His Majesty to give their opinion in writing as to what
they advised should be done, and to sign it with their names.
And all agreed to follow this advice, whatever it might be.
Then, having discussed and considered the affair thoroughly,
they were all of one accord, that war should be made with fire
and sword to punish the Agazes for the wrongs and injuries
they had committed, and were still committing, in the
country. This opinion was unanimous, and signed by all.</p>

<p>In order still further to establish the criminality of their
acts, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez ordered a judicial inquest to be held, and
when this was terminated he added it to four others previously
entered against them before his arrival. The Christians
formerly resident in that country had slain over one
thousand of these Indians because of the losses they were
constantly inflicting upon them.</p>

him all the prisoners they had
taken on that expedition, and that none should be concealed,
under a severe penalty. The Spaniards also brought
theirs, and when all were assembled, he told them His
Majesty had ordered that none of those Guaycur&uacute;s should
be enslaved, because all had not been done that ought
to have been done to ascertain their condition, and that
His Majesty would be rather pleased if these prisoners
were given their liberty. Among these captives was one
of superior breeding and appearance, whom the governor
ordered to be set free, desiring him to summon all his
fellow tribesmen, because he had something to say to them
in the name of the king, and that if they wished he
would protect them, and give them presents, and so he
let him go, giving him some presents; and he departed,
well satisfied, to his own people. Four days afterwards,
he returned accompanied by all his tribe, many of whom
were badly wounded; all came, leaving none behind.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">FOUR</span> days after the departure of the
prisoner, one Monday morning, he
arrived on the bank of the river,
accompanied by all his tribe; and
they halted by a wood on the bank
of the Paraguai. When the governor
was informed of it he sent several canoes across with
some Christians and interpreters to bring them to the town.
Twenty of the Guaycur&uacute;s having crossed in the canoes,
came before the governor, and squatted on one foot in his
presence, as they are accustomed to do. They spoke through
an interpreter, and said as follows: &ldquo;We are the chiefs
of the Guaycur&uacute;s, and our forefathers have always been
at war with all the tribes of this land&mdash;Guaran&iacute;s, Ymperus,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
Agazes, Guatatas, Naper&uacute;s, Mayas, and many others, whom we
have hitherto always vanquished, and no people has ever conquered
us, and we never thought we should be conquered
by anyone. Now we have found others more valiant than ourselves,
and we have come to place ourselves in their power
and be their slaves. You are the chief of the Spaniards,
command us and we will obey your orders. The Guaran&iacute;s
know full well that they are not strong enough to make
war on us; we fear them not. They would never have
dared to interfere with us without the aid of the Spaniards.
Our wives and children are on the opposite bank and are
ready to make their submission as we have done. We speak
in our own name and on behalf of all our tribe. We have
come to offer our submission to the King of the Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>

delivered the prisoners to them.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_h.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> heard what the envoys of the
Guaycur&uacute;s had said, the governor, seeing
that so redoubtable a people had come
to place themselves in his power with so
much submission (a thing that caused
much surprise throughout the land), desired
them to be informed, through interpreters, that he had
come by order of His Majesty to bring all the people to the
knowledge of Our Lord, to be Christians and vassals of His
Majesty, and to be well treated; if they ceased making war
upon the Guaran&iacute;s he would protect and regard them as
friends, and would treat them better than other nations, and
that he would restore all the captives taken from them without
ransom, both those taken by the Spaniards and Guaran&iacute;s.
And this was thereupon done. When the Guaycur&uacute;s had
received them, they affirmed once more their wish to become
vassals of His Majesty, promising obedience and submission,
and that they would henceforth not molest the Guaran&iacute;s,
and that they would bring whatever they took, to the town
for the provisionment of the Spaniards. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez was
much pleased with their promises, and he distributed gifts
and jewels among the chiefs, and peace was cemented.</p>

<p>Since then they have always kept the peace, and whenever
the governor sent for them, hastened to obey his commands.
Every eighth day they came laden with venison
and wild boar, roasted on <i>barbacoas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> These barbacoas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-&nbsp;155&nbsp;-</a></span>
are like gridirons, standing two palms high above the
ground, and made of light sticks. The flesh is cut into steaks
and then laid upon them and roasted. They also brought
much fish and plenty of other provisions, such as grease,
linen mantles woven of a kind of teasel,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> dyed in bright
colours; and skins of the tiger and tapir, deer and other
animals. When they came, the markets for the sale of
all these commodities lasted two days. The natives of
the other side of the river bartered with them; it was a
very great market, and they (the Guaycur&uacute;s) behaved peacefully
towards the Guaran&iacute;s. These gave them, in exchange for
their commodities, maize, manioc, and mandubis; these last
are like hazel nuts or <i>chufas</i>, and grow near the ground<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>;
they also supplied them with bows and arrows. Two
hundred canoes crossed the river together for this market,
laden with all these things; and it was the finest thing
in the world to see them cross. The celerity of their
movements is such that they sometimes collide with one
another, and all the merchandise falls into the water. Then
the Indians to whom this happens, and those awaiting
them on the bank, burst into fits of laughter, and the
jokes and merriment continue all the time the market
is being held. They come to this market in full paint
and in their feathers, and all in this fine plumage are
carried down the river, and they vie one with the other who
shall be the first across; and this is the cause of their frequent
collisions and upsets. In their marketing they talk so loud
and so much, that they cannot hear one another for the
noise, and all are very gay and jolly.</p>

submitted.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="100" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">A <span class="ltrspc">FEW</span> days after the departure of the six
Apir&uacute;s to return to their tribe in accordance
with the instructions of the governor,
some of these people arrived one
Sunday morning on the bank of the river
opposite Ascension, and from the signs
they made it was evident they wished to cross. Thereupon
Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez sent canoes to the other side to find out what
people they were. As the canoes touched the opposite bank the
Indians entered them and came over to the city. On presenting
themselves to the governor they said they were of the tribe
of Apir&uacute;s, and having seated themselves on one foot in token
of their mission being a peaceful one, they stated they were the
chiefs of that tribe, and had come to make acquaintance with
the chief of the Christians and to be friends with him, and
obey his orders.</p>

<p>The expedition against the Guaycur&uacute;s had been noised
through the land, and had caused much fear among all the
tribes, inasmuch as these Indians, the most valiant and redoubtable
of all in that country, should have been attacked and
defeated by the Christians. In proof of the peace and amity
they (the Apir&uacute;s) were desirous of maintaining with the
Christians, they had brought some of their daughters, and
entreated the governor to accept them as hostages and as
proofs of their goodwill and friendship. In the presence of
the captains and clergy, the governor replied that he wished
them to understand that he had come to that country in
order that its people might be brought to the true Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-&nbsp;157&nbsp;-</a></span>
faith and become the subjects of His Majesty; he enjoined
them to make peace with the Guaran&iacute;s, who had become
vassals of the king, and he promised if they would keep the
peace and live in friendship with all the natives of that land,
that he would favour and protect them, and allow them to
come whenever they wished to the city of Ascension to
barter with the Christians and Indians residing there, as the
Guaycur&uacute;s had been allowed to do since peace had been
made with them. To make sure of their loyalty, and to
please them by showing the value he set on their friendship,
he consented to receive as hostages the women and girls they
had brought, entrusting them to the care of the monks and
clergy, in order that they might be instructed in the doctrines
of Christianity, and be taught good manners and customs.
To all this the Indians assented, and showed much pleasure
and satisfaction at becoming the king&rsquo;s vassals. Since that
time they have behaved obediently, and shown a readiness to
obey the governor&rsquo;s orders. The interview terminated, the
Yapir&uacute;s received many presents, and took their departure
well satisfied. These Indians never remain in one place
more than three days, but are continually engaged in hunting
and fishing in order to provide subsistence for their wives
and families. These habits of life, and their want of a fixed
abode, rendered it impossible for the clergy to teach them the
Christian religion, for the necessities of their lives prevented
them from abandoning their nomadic habits, dependent as
they were upon these for the means of procuring food; if, on
the other hand, they were to be compelled to give up this
mode of livelihood, they might die of hunger. Hence it
would be lost labour to teach them, nor could the monks
live with them, owing to the insecurity of remaining among
a people so little to be trusted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">PEACE</span> and tranquillity being now established,
the governor sent a party to
the relief of Buenos Ayres and Captain
Juan Romero, who had been previously
despatched with two brigantines and
some men with the same purpose.
For this new relief the governor
decided on sending Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza and two
other brigantines with provisions and one hundred men.
These dispositions having been taken, he sent for the monks,
clergy, and officers, and spoke to them of the measures to be
adopted for the discovery of the province, especially with
the object of finding a route by land by which the Spaniards
might be supplied with provisions in passing through desolate
uninhabited tracts, of which there were many in that country.
He charged them in His Majesty&rsquo;s name to give this matter
their serious consideration, and advise him in the best way
possible. The following are the names of the monks and
clergy: the commissary, Friar Bernardo de Armenta, Alonzo
Lebron, a Franciscan, Juan de Salazar, of the Order of Mercy,
Luiz de Herrezuelo, of the Order of St. Jerome, Francisco
d&rsquo;Andrada, the bachelor Martin d&rsquo;Almenza, the bachelor
Martinez, and Juan Gabriel de Lezcano, clergymen and
chaplains of the city of Ascension. He also consulted the
captains and officers of His Majesty, and all these, having
discussed the question fully, were of opinion that he should
with all convenient haste proceed to explore the inhabited
country through which the route might lie, into the interior
of the country, for the causes and reasons assigned by the
governor. And this was the order of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-&nbsp;160&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>That he might proceed on this discovery in the best way,
and as promptly as possible, Cabeza de Vaca sent for the
principal Indians and the elders of the Guaran&iacute;s, and told
them of his desire to seek out the tribes in that province of
whom they had often spoken to him; but before doing so he
wished to send some Christians to reconnoitre the route, and
since they (the Guaran&iacute;s) were Christians and vassals of His
Majesty, he asked them kindly to furnish guides from their
own people who knew the country, that by doing so they
would be rendering good service to the king and advancing
their own interests, besides receiving pay and presents for
their services. To this the Indian chiefs responded that they
would go and prepare the people, who would be ready to
start whenever they were required. Many of them offered
on the spot to accompany the Christians, foremost among
these being Aracar&eacute;, a chief of the upper river, and others
whom we shall mention by-and-bye. The goodwill of the
Indians having thus been manifested, three Christians, who
knew the native languages and were experienced men, set
out with the Indians who had offered to undertake the discovery.
The governor recommended them to use the utmost
diligence and fidelity in reconnoitring the road. Meanwhile
he ordered three brigantines to be equipped with provisions
and other necessaries. In these he sent ninety Christians
under the command of Captain Domingo de Irala of Biscay,
with orders to ascend the Paraguai as far as he could, and
discover as much as possible in the space of three months
and a half; to take note of what settlements of natives
there were on the banks of the river, collect every information,
and report to him on the tribes and inhabitants of
that province. The three vessels, with their complement of
Christians, set off on November 20th, 1542. With them
embarked the three Spaniards and the Indians who were to
reconnoitre in advance the route by land from a port on the
Paraguai, known as Las Piedras (the rocks), seventy leagues
above Ascension.</p>

fire, and this was a signal to their enemies to come and attack
them, besides being contrary to the order usually observed in
exploring a new country. Moreover, Aracar&eacute; openly told

discover a road by which they might
enter the province, having returned (as
we have seen) without bringing any
report or information of what had to
be done, and many other natives having
offered to assist the Spaniards in the discovery of the country,
the governor was pleased to speak with the principal among
them who came from the riparian districts and were newly
converted to Christianity, whose names were Juan de Salazar
Cupirati, Lorenzo Moquirasi, Timbuay, and Gonzalo Mayraru,
besides others, and to accept their services, offered with much
alacrity and goodwill, promising them in the name of His
Majesty good pay and handsome reward. Four Spaniards, who
knew the country well, asked to be allowed to proceed on this
discovery with the Indians, promising to use every diligence
in this commission. Seeing this, and that they offered their
services spontaneously, the governor acceded to their request.
Accordingly, these four Spaniards, the Indian chiefs, and
1,500 other natives set out on the 15th December 1542.
Some ascended the river Paraguai in canoes, while others
went by land to Las Piedras, whence they were to make their
entrance into the interior. They were obliged to pass
through the lands and villages of Aracar&eacute;, but would not be
turned from their purpose this time by the words of this
chief, and pursued their march in spite of every attempt on
his part to stop them. Their journey from Las Piedras led
for thirty days through a desolate region, where their
sufferings from hunger were very great. Some of the
Indians died, while the Spaniards were reduced to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-&nbsp;164&nbsp;-</a></span>
straits from hunger and thirst that they lost their way and
did not know where to go. They therefore decided on returning
by the same way as they came, supporting themselves
as well as they could, on the wild thistle and other herbs.
At the end of forty-five days they returned to the city of
Ascension. Aracar&eacute; coming down the river, met them on the
road and caused them much trouble, showing himself in all
this to be the deadly enemy of the Christians and our
friendly Indians. At length the Indians and Christians
arrived at Ascension, feeble and tired. The governor having
learned of the outrageous conduct of Aracar&eacute;, which had
now become notorious, ordered an act of accusation to be
drawn up against him, and to be notified to this chief&mdash;a
somewhat dangerous commission, because Aracar&eacute; came out
with arms in his hands, followed by a number of friends
and relations, with the intent to kill the Spaniards sent to
him. The process, however, was duly served according to
law, and Aracar&eacute; was sentenced to death and executed,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> the
natives being made to understand the just cause for which
this had been done.</p>

was entrusted to Domingo de Irala. Cf. Schmidt, <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 20th December the four brigantines, sent by the
governor to the river Paran&aacute; to the relief of the Spaniards
who had come by ship from the island of St. Catherine,
arrived at Ascension, together with the ship&rsquo;s boat. In these
five craft arrived all the people, who soon disembarked.
With them came Pedro de Estopi&ntilde;an Cabeza de Vaca, who
had been left in command of the vessel and the people.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
He reported that on arriving with his ship in the river
Paran&aacute; he had gone straight to Buenos Ayres, and at the
entrance of that port, near the settlement, he had found a
ship&rsquo;s mast planted in the earth, with an inscription carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-&nbsp;165&nbsp;-</a></span>
on it as follows: &ldquo;<i>Aqu&iacute; esta una carta</i>&rdquo; (Here is a letter). On
searching, this letter was found in a hole bored in the mast.
It was opened, and found to be signed by Alonzo Cabrera,
surveyor of foundries, and by Domingo de Irala of Biscay,
who styled himself lieut.-governor of the province. Its
purport was, that Buenos Ayres had been abandoned, and its
inhabitants removed to the city of Ascension, for reasons set
forth in the letter. Pedro de Estopi&ntilde;an found the place in a
state of revolt, and his men ran imminent risk of death both
from famine and war, for the Guaran&iacute;s attacked them incessantly.
Twenty-five Spaniards, in order to escape starvation,
fled to the coast of Brazil to rejoin the ship, and had not
timely succour arrived all must have perished. As it was,
the day after the arrival of the relieving party, consisting of
150 Spaniards, the Indians attacked them before daybreak,
set fire to their camp, killing and wounding five or six
Spaniards, and in spite of the resistance from the men on
shore, and those on the vessels, their lives were in great
jeopardy. He further reported that measures had been
promptly taken to re-establish the settlement and port of
Buenos Ayres on another site at the confluence of the Rio
Paran&aacute; with the San Juan, but this work had been much
interfered with by the approach of winter, and the floods,
which made breaches in the walls as fast as they were
erected. They were consequently compelled to desist from
their efforts and bring all the people to Ascension.</p>

<p>On the eve of All Saints, or on this day itself, some
disaster always happened to Gonzalo de Mendoza. On this
particular occasion, while navigating at the mouth of the
river, one of his vessels was wrecked, and a number of his
men drowned. It happened in this wise: the vessels were
all at anchor, near the shore, under a high bank, his brigantine
being moored to a tree, when an earthquake took place.
The shore was thrust up, and fell into the river, bringing
down with it the tree to which the galley was moored. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-&nbsp;166&nbsp;-</a></span>
struck the vessel such a tremendous blow as to cause it to
capsize and drift down stream, bottom upwards, for half a
league. Fourteen persons, men and women, were drowned
on this and the other vessels. According to the report of
those who were present, such a terrific thing had never
before occurred. After these experiences they arrived at
Ascension, and were all comfortably lodged and provided
with necessaries. The governor, with all his people, returned
thanks to God for His mercy in having brought them into
safety, and saved them from so many dangers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 4th February of the following
year, 1543, one Sunday morning,
three hours before daybreak, a straw
house in the city of Ascension took
fire, and the flames spread so rapidly
that in a short time the conflagration
was awful to see. The Spaniards
were greatly dismayed, thinking it was the work of Indian
incendiaries, who wished to drive them from the country.
In this emergency the governor caused the alarm to be
sounded, and all hurriedly took up arms and repaired to
their several stations, to be ready to defend their lives and
the place. Owing to these measures, the Spaniards escaped
with their lives, but their property was all destroyed. Upwards
of 200 houses were burnt down, only fifty being saved,
these being separated from the rest by a stream of water
which ran between them. Upwards of 5,000 measures of
maize were burnt in grain, this being the staple production
of the country. A quantity of maize-flour, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">-&nbsp;167&nbsp;-</a></span>
provisions, such as poultry and pigs, were destroyed, and
the Spaniards were reduced to such a state of destitution
that they had no clothes to wear. The fire continued for
four days, burning everything above and below ground,
even to the walls of the town and fortress. It was
ascertained that the fire originated with an Indian woman
living with a Christian, who was shaking a burning hammock,
when a spark fell on the wall of the house; this
being of straw, instantly ignited, and burst into flames.
The governor, seeing the miserable condition of the
Spaniards, whose houses and property had been destroyed,
supplied them with his own things, giving food to those who
had none. In this way he promptly relieved their necessities,
and caused the houses to be rebuilt of less inflammable
materials, using for this purpose clay (<i>tapia</i>). In a few days,
such was the energy displayed, the rebuilding was completed.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 15th February Domingo de Irala,
returning from his exploration of the
Paraguai, moored his three brigantines
in the port of Ascension, and
landed to make his report to the
governor. He said that from the
20th October, when he departed from
Ascension, to the 6th January, the festival of the Three
Kings, he was constantly navigating the river Paraguai,
holding intercourse with the natives along the banks, and
noting down the information they gave him. On that day
he arrived at a settlement of Indians, who cultivate the soil
and rear fowls and geese: the latter as a protection against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-&nbsp;168&nbsp;-</a></span>
crickets, which do them much damage, for these insects
gnaw and eat their mantles, and breed in the straw of which
their houses are built. In order to preserve their garments
they keep them and their furs in large earthenware jars,
covered with clay lids. In this way they protect their
wardrobe. When the crickets fall from the roofs of the
houses in large numbers the geese devour them eagerly, and
this happens two or three times a day, and is a sight worth
seeing. These Indians dwell in the midst of lagoons, and
are called <i>Cacocies Chaneses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> They told Domingo de Irala
that the way into the interior of the country lay through
their territory; he travelled for three days by it, and it
seemed to him a good land; they had also given him an idea
of the regions beyond. There, as he learned, provisions
were abundant enough to supply a party of explorers who
might enter and take possession of the country. These
Indians had shown him specimens of their gold and silver,
and had offered to guide him. During the whole of his
voyage he did not see a more convenient or better country
by which to penetrate into the interior, and he had named
the port where he landed, in honour of the day of his
arrival, <i>Puerto de los Reyes</i> (Port of the Kings<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>). The
inhabitants having expressed a great desire to see the
Spaniards, he entreated the governor to go and make their
acquaintance.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_334_334" id="Footnote_334_334" href="#FNanchor_334_334"><span class="label">[334]</span></a> These Indians are the Xarayos.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_335_335" id="Footnote_335_335" href="#FNanchor_335_335"><span class="label">[335]</span></a> This port was situated in 18&deg; latitude.</p>
</div>

<p>When Domingo de Irala had made his report concerning
all that he had seen and learned, Cabeza de Vaca commanded
the monks and the clergy, the officers and the
captains, to assemble, and caused to be read to them the
report brought by Domingo de Irala. He begged them to
give him their opinion and advice as to what should be
done for the discovery of this country in the service of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-&nbsp;169&nbsp;-</a></span>
and His Majesty, seeing that now the best and most certain
route hitherto known into the interior had been found.
And all the assembly agreed that it was expedient for the
service of God and His Majesty that an entrance into the
country should be made from the port of Los Reyes, and
their opinion was reduced into writing and signed with
their names. They were also of opinion that the discovery
should be made without delay, as provisions and other
necessaries were to be found there in abundance.</p>

<p>Having seen and approved of the opinion of the monks, the
clergy, and the captains, the governor gave orders to equip
and make ready the ten brigantines which had been built for
the service of His Majesty. He bade the Guaran&iacute;s supply
provisions for the voyage, the fire having destroyed the stores
of the Spaniards, and he expended on these preparations his
own resources, paying the Indians for the provisions they
brought, besides giving them many presents. This he did so
as not to delay matters till the next harvest. In order that
everything might be prepared with the utmost speed, he sent
Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza with three brigantines up the
river Paraguai to the lands and villages of the friendly Indians,
vassals of His Majesty, to load these vessels there, ordering
him to pay for everything, and treat the natives in a kindly
way, satisfying them with presents, of which he took a large
number, and he charged him to keep a watch and see that
the interpreters dealt fairly by the Indians, abstaining from
doing them any wrong or compulsion, under threat of
punishment. Those were his orders.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">A <span class="ltrspc">FEW</span> days after Gonzalo de Mendoza
had set out with the three brigantines
he wrote and informed the governor
of his arrival at the port of Giguy,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and
of his having sent into the interior to
those villages where provisions were
obtainable, and that many Indian chiefs had been to
visit him, and had begun bringing in provisions; that
the interpreters had fled from the natives and taken refuge
in the brigantines, because an attempt to kill them had
been made by the friends and relatives of an Indian
who was in revolt and was raising the country against
the Christians and against our Indian allies, advising them
not to give us provisions, and that many Indian chiefs had
come to beg for assistance and help to protect their tribes
against two chiefs named Gua&ccedil;ani and Atabare,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> who with
all their relatives and friends were making war upon them
with fire and sword, burning their settlements and ravaging
their lands, threatening to kill them and destroy them utterly
if they would not unite to drive out the Christians. He
(Gonzalo de Mendoza) was temporising and parleying with
these people till he knew what measures it would be expedient
to adopt, and meanwhile the Indians had brought no
provisions, because the enemy had blocked the roads, and
his Spaniards were starving.</p>

</div>

<p>Having read Gonzalo de Mendoza&rsquo;s letter, the governor
assembled the monks, clergy, officers, and captains, and caused
it to be read to them. He then asked them to give their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">-&nbsp;171&nbsp;-</a></span>
opinion as to what they thought expedient to be done in
that emergency, having regard to the king&rsquo;s instructions,
which were also read to them; and they answered, that since
the Indians were making war against the Christians and His
Majesty&rsquo;s vassals, their opinion was (and it was recorded in
writing and signed with their names) that he should march
against them, and, after demanding peace, should exhort them
to give in their submission; failing which, and after repeating
his request twice, thrice, or as often as was deemed necessary,
and warning them that they would be held responsible for any
evil consequences that might ensue, that then war should be
waged against them as enemies, for the defence and protection
of the friendly natives.</p>

<p>A few days after the above occurrences, the said Captain
Gonzalo de Mendoza wrote again to the governor, informing
him how the Indian chiefs Gua&ccedil;ani and Atabare were
making a cruel war against the friendly natives, over-running
their land, slaying and robbing them, as far as the port where
the Christians were collecting provisions, and that the Indian
allies were much harassed, and were daily beseeching him
(Gonzalo de Mendoza) for aid, and saying that if he did not
soon help them, all the Indians would rise in revolt, reminding
him, too, of the cruel losses such a war entailed upon
them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AFTER</span> reading this letter, and becoming
aware of the complaints made by the
natives, Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez summoned another
council of monks, clergy, and
officers, and, in pursuance of their
advice, commissioned Domingo de Irala
to take measures to protect the Indian allies, and put
an end to the war that had broken out, aiding in every
way those natives who had sustained losses at the hands
of the enemy. To this effect he sent four brigantines with
150 men besides those who had already gone under
the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza, and ordered Domingo
de Irala to proceed at once to the ports and villages of
Gua&ccedil;ani and Atabare, and summon them, in the name
of His Majesty, to desist from the war and to return to
their homes, and live henceforward in peace and amity
with the Spaniards. Should these chiefs refuse to listen to
these proposals, which were to be repeated as often as possible,
that he was then to make war upon them, doing them,
however, as little injury as he could, and avoiding murders,
robberies, and other evils. He was to compel them to make
peace and enter into friendly relations with our Indian allies,
for while this fighting was going on there could be no peace
in the country, and the service of His Majesty would not be
advanced. The governor also sent presents for distribution
among those who were inclined to come to terms.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> Domingo de Irala arrived at the
village of the Indians he sent to
summon Atabare and Gua&ccedil;ani, the
principal instigators of the war.
These chiefs had a large number of
people with them who were prepared
for fighting, and would not listen to
the interpreters when they summoned them to make peace.
They even defied the friendly Indians, robbed and caused
them much injury. While protecting our allies, a number of
skirmishes took place, and some Christians were wounded.
They were sent to Ascension to be healed, but four or five died
of their wounds. It was their own fault, and the consequence
of the excesses they committed, for the wounds were light,
and would not have caused death. One of them died
miserably from a scratch of an arrow on his nose. These
arrows are rubbed with poisonous herbs, and when those
wounded by them commit excesses with women, they die.
In general, however, the herbs of this country are not
dangerous.</p>

<p>The governor wrote again to Domingo de Irala, urging
him to renew friendly relations with the Indians by every
means in his power, because it was advantageous for His
Majesty&rsquo;s service. Indeed, as long as the country was
disturbed by war, surprises, revolts, murders, and robberies,
troubles would never cease. By bringing about a peace, he
wrote, they would be doing their duty towards God and the
king. At the same time he sent a quantity of provisions
for gratuitous distribution among the Indians who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-&nbsp;174&nbsp;-</a></span>
served, adding all that he could think of to strengthen peace
and concord.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Domingo de Irala proceeded
to make peace. He found the enemy much harassed and
fatigued by the war they had been carrying on with the
Spaniards, and desirous of putting an end to it. They were
disposed to come to terms with our Indian allies and renew
their allegiance to the king. Finally, Gua&ccedil;ani and Atabare,
and many other chiefs and people, accepted the conditions
offered them, and came before the governor to ratify the
peace. He told them that in discontinuing hostilities they
had done their duty, that he forgave them their past disobedience,
and that if they rebelled again they would be
punished without mercy. After this he gave them presents,
and dismissed them very happy and contented. Seeing now
that the country was at peace, and the natives living in
concord, the governor ordered them to hasten bringing in
the provisions and other necessaries, in order to equip ten
vessels he was preparing for the discovery of the country by
the port of Los Reyes, in accordance with the resolution come
to. In a few days the natives brought over 3,000 quintals of
manioc flour and maize, and with these he completed loading
the ships, paying for everything to the satisfaction of the
Indians. He also furnished the Spaniards with arms and
other necessaries.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">NOW</span> when the brigantines were on the
point of sailing, and everything was
ready for the voyage of exploration as
recommended by the council, the friars
Bernaldo de Armenta and Alonso
Lebron his companion, were silently
and secretly induced to proceed to the coast of Brazil
by the route explored by the governor, bearing certain
letters for His Majesty, acquainting him with the bad
use the governor was making of the powers and authority
graciously conferred upon him. This was done out
of jealousy and hatred towards the governor, and in
order to hinder his exploration and discovery of the
country, so that his service to the king might be of no
effect. The motive of their conduct was as follows: When
he arrived in that country the governor found everything
disorganised, the Christians in poor circumstances and without
arms, and the inhabitants complaining of the extortionate
behaviour of the officers, who, to advance their personal
interests, had most unjustly levied tribute and a new tax,
contrary to the custom of Spain and the Indies, to which
they gave the name of <i>quinto</i>, as we have already stated in
the course of this narrative. But Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez not suffering
them to continue these exactions, they opposed his discovery,
and it was on this account that the monks were induced by
them to depart. These friars caused the people to swear on
the crucifix that they would not divulge their departure for
Brazil. But when the Indian chiefs had notice of it they
came before the governor, and demanded the restitution of
their daughters, whom they had given up to the monks to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-&nbsp;176&nbsp;-</a></span>
taught the Christian religion, as it had reached their ears that
the monks were intending to go to the coast of Brazil and
carry their daughters along with them; and as they understood
that all those who went thither never returned alive, and
that the girls did not wish to go, and would have run away
were it not that the friars kept them in custody. When the
governor heard this the monks had already set out on their
journey, so he sent after them, and they were overtaken two
leagues from the city and obliged to return. The girls they
were carrying off were thirty-five in number, besides other
Christian converts, all of whom were brought back. This
caused a great tumult among the people, as well Spaniards
as Indians, and great complaint was made by the Indians at
the abduction of their daughters. They also brought before
the governor an Indian named Domingo from the coast of
Brazil, a person of great importance in His Majesty&rsquo;s service.
Then Cabeza de Vaca ordered the depositions against the
monks and officers to be taken, and proceedings were begun
against them for the crime they had committed against His
Majesty. In order that he might not be detained in his
voyage of exploration, he deputed the cause to a judge, and
bade him investigate the whole matter as to the misdeeds of
the accused persons and the charges brought against them.
Two of them he took with him on bail, leaving the others in
prison in the city, suspended from office till such time as His
Majesty should ordain as to what should further be done in
the matter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ALL</span> preparations being now completed
for the voyage of discovery, and the
ten brigantines having been laden with
provisions, the governor selected 400
arquebusiers and archers to accompany
him on that journey. Half of
these embarked on the brigantines, the others, together
with twelve horsemen, went by land along the river bank
as far as the port of Guayvia&ntilde;o, keeping constantly
among settlements of the friendly Guaran&iacute;s, this being
the best route. The horses were taken on the vessels,
but in order that they should not consume the provisions on
board, and might feed themselves on shore, they were sent
eight days beforehand. The factor, Pedro Dorantes, and the
accountant, Philip de Caceres, went with them. Eight days
afterwards the governor embarked, having left as his lieutenant
Juan de Salazar de Espinosa, whom he charged to
administer the province, and govern peacefully and justly in
the name of the king. Two hundred soldiers&mdash;arquebusiers
and archers&mdash;and six horsemen remained behind to protect
and defend the city. On the day of Our Lady of September,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
the church upon which Cabeza de Vaca had himself
worked ever since its destruction by fire was handsomely
finished. He set out from Ascension with twenty brigantines
and 120 canoes. In these were 1,200 Indian warriors,
whose strange appearance, armed with bows and arrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-&nbsp;178&nbsp;-</a></span>
produced a wonderful effect, in their war paint adorned with
plumes and feathers, and wearing on their brows plates of
metal, so that when the sun shone they glittered marvellously.
The Indians said they wore these plates in order that they
might so glitter and dazzle the eyes of the enemy; and they
went forth with loud cries and shouts, all as merry as possible.
When the governor departed from the city he left
word with Captain Salazar to use every effort to complete
the caravel, which he had ordered to be built, and make it
ready against his return, so that he might then send his
report to Spain of all that had happened in his voyage of
exploration. Having made all the necessary dispositions,
and the weather being favourable, he reached the port of
Tapua,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> where he was received by the chiefs. These he told
that he was about to undertake a voyage of discovery of
that land; he therefore begged them always to live in peace
and concord with their neighbours. If they obeyed him
they would always be as well, and better, treated than
heretofore, and he gave presents to be distributed among
them, their sons and relatives, and left them well pleased
and satisfied.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 12th of that month he reached
another port, called <i>Itaqui</i>, where he
moored his brigantines, in order to
hold intercourse with the natives,
who are Guaran&iacute;s and vassals of the
king. That day a large number of
Indians, accompanied by their chiefs,
came laden with provisions, whom the governor informed, as
he had done the others, of his intended voyage of exploration.
These also he exhorted to keep peace with the
Spanish Christians at Ascension, and besides paying them
for the provisions they brought, he distributed presents
among the chiefs and their relatives, leaving them well
satisfied. He stayed here two days and then sailed farther,
passing by a second port, Itaqui, and afterwards moored at
the port of Gua&ccedil;ani&mdash;the chief who revolted with Atabare
in the war I have spoken of, but who was now living in peace
and amity with the Spaniards and their allies. As soon as
these chiefs knew of the arrival of the governor they made
haste to come and see him, whom he received very lovingly,
because they had kept the peace, and all their people were
joyous and confident because these chiefs, their masters,
having entered into friendly relations with the Christians,
all the country was at peace and in tranquillity. The
following day they came again, and he showed them much
affection, and gave them and their relatives many presents,
besides paying for all the provisions they brought, so that
they remained well satisfied. And because they were the
principal chiefs of those natives, the governor spoke to them
in the kindest way, and recommended them to keep peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-&nbsp;181&nbsp;-</a></span>
in all that land, and be diligent in serving and visiting the
Spaniards at Ascension, obeying the orders of His Majesty.
They answered, that since they had made peace they were
determined to keep it, as he would see. In proof of their
obedience, Atabare offered to accompany them, being a man
well experienced in warfare, and Gua&ccedil;ani said he would
remain at home and see that peace was not broken. The
governor thought well of all this, and liking the offer made
by Atabare, he deemed it prudent to accept it, because if
this chief went with him there would be additional security
for the observance of peace. He therefore agreed to his
coming, and gave him richer presents than he had ever
done before, for it was certain that by keeping this chief
satisfied the whole country would remain at peace, and
nobody would dare to raise a rebellion. So the governor
earnestly recommended the Christians to the good offices
of Gua&ccedil;ani, who promised to accomplish all he had undertaken.
The governor remained four days at this place, conferring
with those chiefs and their people, and giving them
presents.</p>

<p>When they were about to leave this port, the horse of the
factor Pedro Dorantes died, so he told the governor he did
not feel disposed to continue in the discovery and conquest of
that province without a horse, and begged that he might be
allowed to return to the city of Ascension, leaving as his
deputy his son, Pedro Dorantes, to serve in the office of factor.
This youth was admitted to the said office in the place of his
father and allowed to accompany the expedition.</p>

<p>Atabare, the Indian chief, set out in company with the
governor, together with thirty relatives and dependents, in
three canoes. Sailing from the port of Gua&ccedil;ani, the expedition
navigated up the Rio Paraguai, and on Friday, the 24th
of September, arrived at the port of Ipaneme,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-&nbsp;182&nbsp;-</a></span>
governor ordered the brigantines to be moored in order to
communicate with the Indians who were vassals of the king,
as well as because he had heard that among those Indians
there was a Guaran&iacute; who had lived for a long while in
captivity with the Payagu&aacute;s and knew their language, their
country, and villages. He wished to take him with him as
interpreter to the Payagu&aacute;s, who had slain Juan de Ayolas
and other Christians, and obtain in a peaceful way the gold
and silver of which they had robbed that leader.</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived at the port all the natives came
towards him, much pleased and laden with provisions. The
governor received them kindly and gave orders that they
should be paid for all they brought. To the chiefs he gave
many presents, and having spoken and dealt with them, he
gave them to understand the necessity he was in of having
that Indian as interpreter, so as to bring about friendly
relations with the Payagu&aacute;s, and to guide his army by the
best route to the settlements of the interior. Then these
Indians immediately sent in search of him, to find him out
with the least possible delay.</p>

port and went further up the river Paraguai, and in
four days&rsquo; time arrived at the port of Guayvia&ntilde;o, which
is the extreme point occupied by the Guaran&iacute;s. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-&nbsp;183&nbsp;-</a></span>
ordered his vessels to be moored, in order that he might speak
with the natives, who came to see him with their chiefs,
laden with provisions, and the governor received them very
well, and treated them and their chiefs in the same gracious
manner. These natives informed him that his cavalry were
marching through the country, and had already passed
through some of their settlements, where they had been
well received and provisioned, and that they had been
directed on the road to Itabitan,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> where they intended to
await the arrival of the brigantines. As soon as he heard
these tidings the governor ordered his flotilla to set sail, and
departed from the port of Guayvia&ntilde;o, and, having a fair wind,
went on navigating up the river. That same day, at nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he reached the port of Itabitan,
where he found his cavalry arrived in good condition. They
informed him that they had travelled through the country,
keeping on good terms with the inhabitants, to whom they
had distributed the gifts they had taken with them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">CABEZA DE VACA</span> remained two
days in the port of Itabitan, during
which time the horses were embarked
and everything concerning the armada
arranged in orderly fashion. The
country of the Payagu&aacute;s being now
near at hand, he ordered that the Indian interpreter from
Ipaneme should be taken on board the leading vessel and
give directions as to what had to be done. He then set
sail with a fair wind from that port. In order to protect
the Guaran&iacute;s who were with him from the attacks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-&nbsp;184&nbsp;-</a></span>
Payagu&aacute;s, he ordered the former to unite their canoes in one
body and keep close to the brigantines, and in this way
pursue their voyage in good order. At night he directed
that all the flotilla should moor alongside the bank, he
himself sleeping on shore with a strong guard, the canoes
of the Guaran&iacute;s being attached to the brigantines. The
Spaniards and Indians occupied a full league of land along
the river, and their numerous camp-fires presented a very
pretty sight. During all this navigation the governor provided
food for all the people, Spaniards and Guaran&iacute;s, and
supplied them well with everything&mdash;fish in great abundance
and game, so that they had more than they could eat. In
this river there is a kind of wild pig that is constantly in
the water, larger than ours in Spain; these animals are
aquatic in their habits, remaining on land at night, while in
the daytime they are always in the water, and when they
see a person they plunge into the river and sink to the
bottom, remaining a long time under water.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> When they
reappear on the surface of the water they are at an arrow&rsquo;s
flight from the place where they dived. In the chase of
this pig not less than six canoes take part, for, when the
animal dives, three go up the river and three go down. The
hunters have their bows ready, and, as the animal comes to
the surface, they shoot three or four arrows with great
rapidity at them before they dive again, and so they pursue
them till at length they float on the surface dead of their
wounds. Their flesh is considered good to eat by the
Spaniards, and there is plenty of it, many parts of this river
abounding with these pigs. Our people were so strong and
lusty on this voyage that they looked as though they had
just arrived from Spain. The horses, too, were in good
condition; they were taken on shore several times to hunt
deer, tapirs, wild boar, many otters, and other animals.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 12th October the governor arrived
at the port of Candelaria, and the
country of the Payagu&aacute;s. It was
here that Captain Juan de Ayolas
entered with his Spaniards, and hither
he returned after his exploration,
expecting to find Domingo de Irala,
whom he had left in charge of the brigantines, which
he had taken with him. Here he remained four months
awaiting their arrival, during which time he and his
men suffered terribly from hunger. At length the
Payagu&aacute;s, having learned of his weak condition and
want of arms, began treating him with familiarity, and
offered to receive him and his men into their houses and
support them. Then they suddenly fell upon them as they
were crossing some marshes full of rushes; every Christian
was seized by two Indians armed with poles who struck them
several blows on the head, and so they slew Captain Juan
de Ayolas and eighty Spaniards, being all that remained of
the one hundred and fifty who had gone on that expedition.
The blame of their death rests with him who had been left
in charge of the brigantines, and who, instead of awaiting
their return, abandoned them to their fate, and descended
the river to please himself. Had Juan de Ayolas found the
brigantines there when he returned, he would have embarked
and escaped massacre at the hands of these Indians. But
Domingo de Irala acted with bad faith, to the intent that
Juan de Ayolas might be slain, and that he might raise
a revolt in the land against God and the king. This he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-&nbsp;186&nbsp;-</a></span>
afterwards succeeded in, and, to the present day, he is
actually in revolt, having destroyed and laid waste all that
land, and for twelve years he continues to govern it tyrannically.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_344_344" id="Footnote_344_344" href="#FNanchor_344_344"><span class="label">[344]</span></a> This is reckoned from the end of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez&rsquo;s government, 1543,
to the date of publication of this work in Valladolid, 1555.</p>
</div>

<p>The pilots observed here to obtain the elevation of the
pole, and found the latitude of that port to be in twenty-one
degrees less one-third of a degree.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Having arrived here, the
armada was assembled before opening communications with
the Payagu&aacute;s and ascertaining where their settlements were
situated. The following morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, seven
Payagu&aacute;s appeared on the bank of the river, and the governor
ordered an equal number of Spaniards, together with the
interpreter (who proved very useful), to treat with them, as
they were desirous of speaking with them, and of coming to
a peaceful arrangement, the captain of the expedition having
no other object but that of peace. Having conversed a little
while, the Indians asked if these Christians, who had now
arrived in the brigantines, were the same as those who
formerly went about the country. The Spaniards, who had
been warned beforehand, answered that they were not the
same as those others, but were newly arrived in the country.
Upon this, one of the Payagu&aacute;s came among the Christians,
and was immediately brought before the governor. He asked
him, through the interpreter, by whose order he had come.
The man answered that his chief, having learned of the
arrival of the Spaniards, had sent him to inquire if it were
true they were the same people as those who went formerly
in the country, and to say that his chief wished to be the
friend of the governor, and that all that had been taken from
Juan de Ayolas and from the Christians was kept together,
and placed in security ready to be restored to the chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-&nbsp;187&nbsp;-</a></span>
the Christians, in order that peace might be made with them,
and to obtain pardon for the murder of Ayolas and the other
Christians who had been slain in war. The governor then
asked him how much gold and silver they had taken from
Juan de Ayolas and from the Christians, and he showed, by
signs, that it would amount to sixty-six loads such as the
Chan&eacute;s Indians are accustomed to carry, and that it was all
in plates, bracelets, crowns, and axes; also that there were
small vases of gold and silver. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez charged that
Indian, through the interpreter, to tell his chief that His
Majesty had sent him to that land to establish peace with
them and other tribes that would accept it, and that the past
wars would be forgiven. He added that if his chief sought
friendship, and would be willing to restore all that had been
taken from the Spaniards, he should come in person and
speak with him (the governor), as he was very desirous of
seeing him, and would treat him well, and receive him as a
vassal of the king. In token of peace, he sent him several
presents, and gave other things as well to the Indian himself,
and asked him when he would return with his chief.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_345_345" id="Footnote_345_345" href="#FNanchor_345_345"><span class="label">[345]</span></a> This is an error of one and two-thirds of a degree. The exact
latitude of <i>Candelaria</i> was 19 degrees, where now is Corumb&aacute;.</p>
</div>

<p>This chief, though a fisherman, is lord of this miserable
people (for all are fishermen); he is a very grave man, feared
and respected by his people, and, if anyone offend him and
make him angry, he takes a bow, and shoots two or three
arrows into him. If the man be killed, he sends for the
wife (if there be one), and gives her a bead to appease
her wrath at the murder of her husband. If he have
no bead to give her, then a couple of feathers. When this
chief wishes to spit, one that is nearest to him joins his hands
together so that he should spit into them. These, and such
like extravagances, are practised by this chief. All along the
river there is no Indian that owns such things as he does.
The interpreter promised that he and his chief would be
there again the next morning, and so he left the governor in
expectation.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THAT</span> day and four more having passed
without the return of the Indian
Payagu&aacute;, the governor sent for the
interpreter, and asked him what he
thought of this delay. And he said
that he believed the chief would certainly
never make his appearance, because the Payagu&aacute;s
are very sly and cautious; that the chief&rsquo;s motive for sending
an envoy to treat for peace was only to gain time and
prevent the Spaniards and Guaran&iacute;s from advancing and
finding out the settlements of the Payagu&aacute;s, and that while
they (the Spaniards) were waiting the arrival of the chief,
the Payagu&aacute;s were removing their settlements, wives, and
children, and that he thought they had fled to some place of
concealment higher up the river. He advised the governor
to follow, as he was certain that he would overtake them,
because he knew they would be heavily loaded. In his
opinion, the Payagu&aacute;s would continue their flight till they
reached a lagoon formerly inhabited by a tribe called the
Mataraes, whom these Payagu&aacute;s had slain and destroyed
and had taken possession of their land because it abounded
in fisheries.</p>

<p>The governor immediately gave orders to raise anchors,
and brigantines and canoes went on navigating up the river.
Wherever he halted, great numbers of the Payagu&aacute;s might
be seen along the bank, who, as the interpreter had said, were
going by land with their wives and children, because the
canoes could not contain them. After eight days&rsquo; navigation
the governor arrived at the lagoon of the Mataraes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-&nbsp;189&nbsp;-</a></span>
entered it, without finding the Indians he was in search of
there. He entered with half his people to seek them out and
treat with them, but seeing they did not appear, and in order
not to waste his provisions, he ordered all the Christians and
Guaran&iacute;s to return. They had found certain canoes with
their paddles concealed under the water, and had seen the
track by which the Indians had withdrawn; but the governor
would not delay any longer, so, reassembling his people
and collecting all the brigantines and canoes together, he
pursued his navigation up the river, sometimes sailing, at
other times rowing and towing, because of the many bends
in its course, till he arrived at a part of its banks where
many cassia trees grow.</p>

<p>These are very lofty and vigorous trees, yielding a fruit
one palm and a half in length and as thick as three fingers.
The people ate much of it, and the inside is as sweet as
honey. It does not differ the least from that kind which is
brought into Spain from other countries, except that it
is much larger and rougher to the taste, because it is uncultivated.
There are eighty of these trees united together on
the bank of the Paraguai. In these parts of the river there
was an abundance of wild fruit, which the Spaniards and
Indians ate. Among them was one like a lemon of Ceuti in
colour, acidity, peel, and smell, but smaller, no larger than the
size of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg. The tree bearing this fruit has leaves
like a lemon. There is a great variety of trees and fruits in
this country, and a wonderful diversity of fish, the quantity
killed by the Indians and Spaniards surpassing belief. Whenever
the wind was unfavourable for sailing they hunted the
water-pigs and otters (which were also abundant), using for
this purpose the light, swift canoes of the natives. This was
a great pastime.</p>

<p>As we were now approaching the country of the Guaxarapos
Indians, who inhabit the bank of the Paraguai, and are
neighbours and traffic with the port of Los Reyes, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-&nbsp;190&nbsp;-</a></span>
we were bound, and as these Indians might have been alarmed
at such a multitude of people and canoes, and might have
fled inland, the governor, in order to allay their fears and
pacify them, divided his flotilla into two parts, and, taking
five brigantines and half the canoes, led the advance, leaving
Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza to follow with the other
vessels, canoes, and people, charging him to govern all the
people kindly and not abuse his authority. He particularly
warned him not to allow any wrongs or violence to be committed
upon the native riverine population, and to pay for all
the provisions he took, so as to keep the peace and safeguard
His Majesty&rsquo;s interests in that land. Taking with him the
five brigantines and the canoes, the governor continued his
voyage as I have stated, and, on the 18th October, arrived
at a settlement of Guaxarapos Indians. Here thirty Indians
having come out, he halted his flotilla within earshot, and
addressed them through the interpreter, repeating what he
had said to the other tribes lower down the river, exhorting
them to give their submission to the king, and promising, if
they did so, he would regard them as friends. They accordingly
submitted; one of their number was a chief, to whom
the governor gave presents and promised to do what he
could for them.</p>

<p>Not far from the place where we met these Indians
flowed another river. It is about half the width of the
Paraguai, with a violent current, and it falls into this river,
which comes from Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> This was the river along which,
old men tell, Garcia the Portuguese came and made war in
that land. He entered it at the head of a large number of
Indians, fought many battles, and destroyed many tribes,
having only five Christians with him. The Indians say that
he was never seen to return. He brought with him a
mulatto named Pacheco, who returned to the country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-&nbsp;191&nbsp;-</a></span>
Gua&ccedil;ani, who killed him on the spot. Garcia returned to
Brazil. Of his Guaran&iacute; followers many are said to have
been lost in the interior, and the natives told us that we
should find many of them there from whom we might
obtain information concerning the deeds of Garcia and the
nature of the country. Some Indians, called Chaneses, had
also sought refuge there, and had allied themselves with
the Sococies and Xaquetes, who live near the port of Los
Reyes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_346_346" id="Footnote_346_346" href="#FNanchor_346_346"><span class="label">[346]</span></a> This river must have been the Cuyab&aacute;.</p>
</div>

<p>Having obtained this information from the Indians the
governor pushed on to see the river by which Garcia had
come, for he was near the place indicated by the Guaxarapos.
When he had arrived at the mouth of the river called
Iapaneme, he caused soundings to be taken, and the depth
was found to be very great. This river has a rapid current,
and is bordered on either bank by trees. Cabeza de Vaca
ordered one of the brigantines to ascend it for a league and
continue the soundings, all of which proved its depth to be
great. The Guaxarapos said that along its banks lived
various tribes, who cultivated maize and manioc and had
large fisheries, obtaining as much fish as they could eat, and
extracting oil from these fish, besides killing a quantity
of game. The party sent to explore this river reported
having seen smoke in several places on the banks&mdash;a sign of
settlements. It was already late when the exploring party
returned, and the governor ordered that the vessels should
be moored that night off the mouth of that river, at the
foot of a range of hills called Santa Lucia. This sierra was
crossed by Garcia. The following morning the pilots
observed the elevation, and found the estuary of the river to
be in nineteen degrees and one-third.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> That night a heavy
fall of rain, accompanied by a strong wind, caused us great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-&nbsp;192&nbsp;-</a></span>
inconvenience. Great fires were made on shore, and many
of the people slept by them, while the others remained on
board the vessel under coverings of mats and skins.</p>

<h4>How the Guaxarapos spoke with the governor.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THAT</span> morning the Guaxarapos, who had
been the previous day to speak with
the governor, came again in two
canoes with supplies of fish and meat,
which they distributed among our
people, and, having spoken once more
with the governor, and received promises of friendship and
protection, took their departure. He told them of the other
vessels, canoes, and soldiers that were behind, and begged
them to receive them kindly and treat them well, as in such
case they would suffer no injury; this they promised they
would do, but did not keep their word. The cause of this
was certainly a Christian, who was punished for it, as I shall
presently relate.</p>

<p>The governor left those Indians, and continued his navigation
of the river all that day with a fair wind, arriving at
sunset at certain settlements belonging to the same tribe of
Indians on the river shore, near the water&rsquo;s edge; but in
order not to lose time, and favourable weather for the
voyage, he passed on without stopping. These people are
agriculturists, sowing maize and other roots, hunting and
fishing a great deal, both fish and game being abundant.
Men and women wear the skins of wild animals, except a
few, who only cover their privities. They tattoo their faces
in points and lines, and pierce the lips and ears. Their canoes
are only large enough to contain two or three persons at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">-&nbsp;193&nbsp;-</a></span>
time. They are exceedingly light, and the skill with which
they manage them is admirable. When going up or down
the river, the motions of these canoes are so swift that they
appear to be flying. A brigantine (though made of cedar
wood), and whether propelled by oars or sail, cannot overtake
one of these skiffs, though the latter have only two oars,
whereas the brigantines have a dozen. They fight in their
canoes on the river as well as on land; nevertheless, they
traffic with one another, bartering bows and arrows for
canoes, which are supplied to them by the Guaxarapos and
Payagu&aacute;s, besides other things. So they become, by turns,
friends and enemies with one another.</p>

<h3 class="pgbreak"><a name="FIFTY-SECOND" id="FIFTY-SECOND">CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SECOND.</a></h3>

<h4>How the Indians come and establish themselves on the
shore of the river.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> the waters are low, the people
from the interior come and live on the
banks of the river with their wives
and children, and pass their time in
fishing, for the fish are abundant and
very fat at this season. They lead
pleasant lives, dancing and singing day and night, like
persons who are relieved from all anxiety about food; but
when the water begins to rise, which is in January, they
retire inland, because at that season the floods begin, and
the waters rise six fathoms above the banks of the river.
At such time the country is under water for over one hundred
leagues inland, spreading over everything like a sea, so that
even tall palms and other trees are covered, and vessels may
pass over their summits. This usually happens every year,
when the sun crosses one tropic and approaches the other in
the latitude of the mouth of the <i>rio del oro</i>. At such times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-&nbsp;194&nbsp;-</a></span>
the natives keep very large canoes in readiness for this
emergency; and in the middle of these canoes they throw
two or three loads of mud, and make a hearth. The Indian
then enters with his wife, children, and household goods,
and floats on the rising tide wherever they like. He lights
a fire on the hearth to cook his food and for warmth, and
thus he voyages for four months of the year, or as long as
the floods last. While the waters are rising he lands at
certain spots not yet inundated, and kills deer, tapirs, and
other wild animals which have escaped the flood. As these
retire into their channels, he returns the same way, hunting
and fishing, and not leaving his canoe till the banks whereon
he is wont to dwell are uncovered.</p>

<p>It is a sight to see the enormous quantity of fish left on
the dry land after the waters have subsided. This happens
in the month of March or April, when all that country
smells awfully bad, owing to the poisonous mud which covers
it. At this period all the natives, and we ourselves, were
very ill, so that we thought we should die; and, as it is then
summer in these parts, it is barely endurable. In the month
of April the sick begin to recover.</p>

<p>All these Indians spin the thread, of which they make
their nets, of a kind of teasel. These teasels are pounded and
thrown into muddy pools; after leaving them there fifteen
days, they take them out and scrape them with mussel-shells;
the fibre is then clean and white as snow.</p>

<p>This tribe, unlike others, has no chief; they are all fishers
and woodsmen, inhabiting the borders of the country.
These, and all the other people living on the river by which
we were now passing, would not suffer any Spaniard or
Guaran&iacute; to land. In order that they should not molest his
people, the governor distributed some presents among them,
and told them of the other ships that were following with
his friends, whom he begged them to receive and entertain
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-&nbsp;195&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Continuing the voyage one Friday morning, we arrived at
a rapid, where the river passes between steep rocks. Large
quantities of gold-fish (<i>dorados</i>) descend this rapid, and it
was the largest rapid we had yet met with. We passed it
sailing and rowing. Here the Spaniards and Indians caught
in one hour large quantities of gold-fish, as many as forty of
them being taken by one man. These fish are so big that
they weigh half an arroba<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> each, and some as much as one
arroba. They are excellent eating, the head being the best
part. A quantity of oil is extracted from these fish, and
those who eat of it become fat and sleek. Broth made of
them, if taken continuously for a month, cures skin diseases
and leprosy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_348_348" id="Footnote_348_348" href="#FNanchor_348_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> The arroba is a Spanish weight, equal to twenty-five pounds of
sixteen ounces each.</p>
</div>

<p>Continuing the voyage with a fair wind, the governor
arrived, on the evening of the 25th October, at a place where
the river divides into three channels. One arm forms a great
lagoon, which the Indians call the Black River; it runs towards
the north into the interior of the country. The other arms,
in which the water is of a good colour, reunite a little way
further down. The governor continued his navigation till
he came to the mouth of a river which flows into the interior
of the country to the left, towards the west. Here the Paraguai
loses itself in a number of other river channels and lagoons.
And the navigation is so intricate that the Indians themselves,
who are always navigating them, have difficulty in
distinguishing one from the other, and often lose their way.
The river now entered by the governor is called by the
natives Yguatu,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> meaning &ldquo;good water.&rdquo; It flows towards
the lagoon in our favour. Hitherto we had been ascending
against the current; we now went down stream.</p>

<h4>How they erected three crosses at the mouth of the river
Yguat&uacute;.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor ordered several sign-posts
to be made at the mouth of this
river of felled trees. He then had
three high crosses erected to serve as
signs for vessels, in order that they
might not mistake the entrance.
During three days we advanced by rowing; then we left
the river, and ascended two of its arms which have their
source in large lagoons.</p>

<p>On the eighth of the month, one hour before daybreak, we
arrived at some high and round craggy rocks in the middle
of the river. They are bell-shaped, contracting towards the
summit. These rocks are completely barren, producing neither
tree nor herb. Their colour is red. We believe they contain
much metal, because the country beyond the river is mountainous,
forested, and clothed with grass; these rocks, on the
other hand, have nothing of the kind, an indication that they
contain much metal, because, wherever this is found, neither
trees nor grasses grow. The Indians told us that, in bygone
times, their forefathers obtained white metal here; but as all
our people were ill, and as we had no mining nor founder&rsquo;s
tools with us, nor the implements necessary to probe and
search for ore, the governor did not cause search to be made
for the metal, leaving it for another time when he passed by
that way again, for these rocks are near the port of Los
Reyes.</p>

<p>Pursuing our voyage up the river, we entered a lagoon
upwards of one league and a half in width at its entrance,
and, issuing from it by a second mouth, came to the dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">-&nbsp;197&nbsp;-</a></span>
land. At ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning we anchored at the
entrance of another lagoon where the Sacosies, Xaqueses,
and Chaneses had established their settlements. The
governor did not wish to go any further without acquainting
the Indians of his arrival. He accordingly sent an interpreter
with some Christians in a canoe to speak with them
in his name and summon them to an interview. These
envoys returned at five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and announced
that the Indians had come forth to receive them, showing
great pleasure, and telling the interpreter that they already
knew of their arrival and were desirous of seeing the governor
and the Christians. They reported that the waters had
fallen a good deal, and by reason of this it had been difficult
to take their canoe there; that in order to pass the shallows
and arrive at the port of Los Reyes, it would be necessary
to lighten the vessels, as the depth was only one span,
whereas the draught of the loaded brigantines was five
or six. These shallows were near the port of Los Reyes.
The following day the governor ordered the departure of
the ships and of all the people, Christians and Indians.
They rowed till they came to the shallows, when everybody
had orders to get into the water, which did not reach
to the knee. Then the Indians and Christians ranged
themselves round the sides of the brigantine named <i>St.
Mark</i>, and pushed with their shoulders, nearly lifting her
out of the water by the strength of their arms without
unloading her. That shallow was more than an arquebuss
shot and a half long, and the difficulty of passing
it was very great. When this was over, the other brigantines
were passed in the same way with less trouble,
because they were smaller. Having floated them into deep
water we disembarked at Los Reyes, where we found a
great assemblage of natives with their wives and children
waiting for us. The governor and all his people landed, and
the natives came towards them. He told them that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-&nbsp;198&nbsp;-</a></span>
been sent by His Majesty to warn them to be Christians and
receive the Christian doctrine, to believe in God the creator
of heaven and earth, and to be the vassals of the king. If
they did this they would be protected and defended against
their enemies and against all who would injure them, and
that they would be well treated and looked after in accordance
with His Majesty&rsquo;s orders; if they conducted themselves
well he would not fail to give them presents, as he always
did to those who were good. He then convoked the clergy
and told them he wished a church built where Mass could be
said and other divine rites celebrated for an example and
comfort to the other Christians; and he charged them to
have a special care of these. He ordered a large wooden
cross to be erected on the bank of the river, under some tall
palms, in the presence of the officers and many others there
present. He took formal possession of the country in the
name of His Majesty, and in the presence of the notary, as
newly discovered land, and, having conciliated the natives
by bestowing presents upon them, he ordered the Spaniards
and Guaran&iacute;s to take up their quarters on the shore of the
lagoon, cautioning them to do the natives no injury or
violence, because they were friendly, and vassals of the king.
Moreover, he gave them strict orders not to enter the native
settlements and houses, because what the Indians fear and
hate most, and what irritates them more than anything, is
to see the Christians, accompanied by Indians, entering
their houses, disturbing their things, and taking away the
few possessions they have. If they trafficked with them,
they were to pay for whatever they bought, or they would
be punished.</p>

<h4>How the Indians of the port of Los Reyes cultivate the soil.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> Indians of this port of Los Reyes
are agriculturists, and sow maize and
manioc (the cassava of the Indies), and
an abundance of <i>mandubies</i> (which
are like large filberts). They sow
twice a year. The land is fertile,
abounding in provisions, game, and fisheries. These Indians
rear numbers of geese, as a protection against crickets (as I
have described). They also rear fowls, and shut these up
at night to protect them from bats, which cut off their
combs, and, in this way, cause their death. These bats
are an evil kind of animal, and numerous on the banks
of the river. They are larger than our doves in Spain,
with teeth so sharp that their bite is not felt. They never
bite a man except in the toes and the tip of the nose. When
several persons are together, and this animal has bitten one,
he will not touch the others, but never leaves that one he
has attacked. They bite at night, but never appear in the
day-time. We had great difficulty in protecting our horses&rsquo;
ears from them. When a bat enters a stable, the horses
become so frightened that they waken all the people in
the house, and it is impossible to quiet them till the bat
has been killed or driven out. The governor was bitten
by one of those animals while he was asleep in a brigantine,
one of his feet being uncovered. All night the blood
kept on flowing, till he woke from feeling his leg cold,
and finding the bed soaked with blood, thought somebody
had wounded him; but those on board searched for the
place where he was wounded, and, when they found what
they knew, by experience, to be the bite of a bat, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">-&nbsp;200&nbsp;-</a></span>
laughed. The governor found that a slice of his toe had
been bitten off. These bats always bite where there is a
vein. They served us a bad trick on one occasion. When
we were starting on our voyage of exploration we had six
pregnant sows, and hoped to rear a race of pigs. When the
little pigs were born, and tried to suck their mother, they
could not find her teats, because these had been bitten off
by the bats; so the young pigs died, and we had to eat
the sows, because they were unable to rear their young.</p>

<p>There are other bad animals in this country; these are
very large ants of two kinds, red and black. It is most
pitiable to see a person who has been stung by either of
these ants, for he utters loud cries, and rolls on the ground
for twenty-four hours, during which the pain lasts; and
there is no remedy for it. There are very many rays in this
lagoon, and, if a fisherman happen to tread on one, it bends
its body up, and inflicts a smart blow with the tip of its tail,
which is about the thickness of a finger, and has a saw-like
edge. This fish is about the size of a <i>xeme</i>,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and, if the
blow it delivers strike the foot, it goes right through, and
the pain is as intense as that from the ant-stings; but it
may be stopped at once by chewing and applying to the
wound a certain weed the Indians know of. This takes the
pain away completely, though the wound does not heal for a
month.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_350_350" id="Footnote_350_350" href="#FNanchor_350_350"><span class="label">[350]</span></a> The <i>xeme</i> is the span from the extremity of the thumb to that of
the forefinger, when stretched to their utmost, equal to about six
inches.</p>
</div>

<p>The natives of this country are of average height. They
are quite naked, and pierce holes in their ears large enough
to pass the fist through; in these they insert gourds of a
medium size, afterwards replacing them by larger ones, distending
the lobe of the ear till it hangs down to the shoulder.
For this reason they are called <i>Orejones</i>, like the Incas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">-&nbsp;201&nbsp;-</a></span>
Peru. When they fight, they take these gourds or discs
out of their ears and roll them up, or else tie their ears
behind their heads. The women do not cover their nakedness.
Every person lives separately with his wife and
children. The occupation of the women is to spin cotton;
the men cultivate the fields, returning to their homes in the
evening, when they find their meals ready. The women do
no other work except at harvest time, when they assist in
gathering the maize, and garnering it. From that place the
Indians begin to be idolaters; they worship idols made of
wood; but, according to the reports brought to the governor,
those farther inland have idols of gold and silver.</p>

<p>The governor tried, with kind words, to turn the natives
of Los Reyes from idolatry, persuading them to burn their
idols, and believe only in God, who created heaven and
earth, man, the sea, fish, and every living creature, and that
he whom they worshipped was the devil, who deceived them.
They burned some of their idols, but their chiefs were
frightened, saying the devil would kill them, and that he
would be angry with them. As soon as the church was built,
and Mass had been said, the devil fled from that country
and left the Indians in peace and tranquillity. This was the
first settlement of the <i>campo</i>; it was a little over half a
league in extent, and contained eight hundred houses of
agriculturists.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor informed himself through
these Chaneses about the interior of
the country, and concerning its settlements,
how many days&rsquo; journey these
were from the port of Los Reyes.
The chief of the Chaneses, who was
about fifty years of age, said that when Garcia brought them
from their country they accompanied him through the lands
of the May&aacute;es<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> to those of the Guaran&iacute;s, who slew the
Indians he brought with him, and this chief and others of
his tribe escaped, and fled along the bank of the Paraguai,
up this river till they came to the settlement of the Sacosies,
who received them. They durst not go home the way they
came with Garcia, for fear lest the Guaran&iacute;s should overtake
and kill them. They could not say, therefore, how far it was
to the villages of the interior; this circumstance, and their
ignorance of the road, prevented them from returning to
their country. The Guaran&iacute;s, however, inhabiting the
mountainous region knew the way, and could show it, for
they were accustomed to come and go in their wars against
the Indians of the interior. In answer to questions put
to him about the inhabitants of his country, their manner
of life, and mode of making war, he said that all the people
in his land obeyed one chief, who was over all, and many
of his tribe were at war with Indians, called <i>Chimencos</i> and
<i>Carcaracs</i>, and there were numerous other tribes in that land,
known as the Gorgototquies, Paysun&oacute;es, Esterapec&oacute;cies and
Candir&eacute;es, who had all their own chiefs, and made war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-&nbsp;204&nbsp;-</a></span>
Their weapons are bows and arrows, and they are mostly
agriculturists. They rear animals, sow maize, manioc,
potatoes and <i>mandubies</i>, and keep geese and fowls like
those of Spain. They also rear large sheep (<i>llamas</i>), and
make war one upon the other. They barter bows and
arrows, mantles, and other things for bows, arrows, and
women. Having given this information, these Indians
went away well satisfied. Their chief offered to accompany
the governor on his expedition of discovery, saying that he
would return to his country with his wife and children, and
what he most desired was to live in his own country.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> obtained all the information
he could from the Indian chief, the
governor ordered some Spaniards to
go and find out the Guaran&iacute;s of that
land, in order to get information from
them and guides for his voyage of
discovery. Some Guaran&iacute;s of those he had brought with
him accompanied the Spaniards, who set out preceded by
guides. At the end of six days they returned and reported
that those Guaran&iacute;s had left the country, for they had found
the villages and houses deserted, and the whole region
depopulated since they had gone for ten leagues round it,
without finding a living soul. Having heard this, the
governor asked the Chaneses if they knew into what
part the Guaran&iacute;s had gone. They answered that the
natives of that port and island had joined together, and
made war against those Guaran&iacute;s, and had killed many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-&nbsp;205&nbsp;-</a></span>
them; the remainder had fled into the interior. They
believed that the Guaran&iacute;s would join with other tribes
of the same nation, who lived near to a people called
Xarayes, against whom, and other tribes, they were at
war. According to their information, the Xarayes possess
gold and silver given to them by the Indians of the interior;
in that direction all the country is inhabited, and he might
go to those settlements. The Xarayes, they added, are
agriculturists: they sow maize and other seeds in large
quantities, rear geese and poultry like those of Spain.</p>

<p>The governor asked how many days&rsquo; march it was from
the port of Los Reyes to the Xarayes&rsquo; land, and they
answered that the journey could not be made by land,
because the road was very bad, owing to the numerous
swamps and lakes, but that if he chose to go thither by
water in canoes, it would take eight or ten days.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">SOON</span> after this the governor convoked
the officers and the clergy, and having
told them of the report made concerning
the Xarayes and Guaran&iacute;s
living on the frontier, it was decided
that two Spaniards and two Guaran&iacute;s
should go with some natives of the
port to speak with the Xarayes, and find out what kind of
land it was, and collect information concerning the settlements
and tribes of the interior, and the road thither; they were also
to speak with the Guaran&iacute;s, as from them they would be more
fully and surely informed of the truth. That very day the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-&nbsp;206&nbsp;-</a></span>
Spaniards started, and their names were Hector de Acu&ntilde;a
and Antonio Correa, interpreters of the Guaran&iacute; language,
with ten Indian Sacosies, and two Guaran&iacute;s. The governor
ordered them to tell the chief of the Xarayes that they
were envoys sent to speak with him, and contract friendship
with him and his people; that he begged him to
come and see him, as he wished for a personal interview.
The Spaniards were moreover desired to obtain information
of the tribes and settlements in the interior, and of the route
leading thither. Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez gave the Spaniards several
presents, and a scarlet cap to present to the chief of the
Xarayes, and another one for the chief of the Guaran&iacute;s,
to whom they were to say the same as to the chief of
the Xarayes.</p>

<p>The following day Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza arrived
with his troops and vessels, and reported that on the eve of
All Saints&rsquo; day, while navigating past the country of the
Guaxarapos, after speaking with this people, who gave themselves
out as friends (saying that they had done the same
with those who had passed before), the wind being contrary,
and the Spaniards about to moor the brigantines, just as
the five leading vessels were turning an elbow of the river,
under sail, and one brigantine, commanded by Agustin de
Campos, was behind, being towed along the shore, the
Guaxarapos, seeing that its crew were all ashore, attacked
them, and killed five Christians; and that Juan de Bola&ntilde;os,
while trying to swim to the vessel, was drowned. Our people
had thought they were so safe, and were so confident,
believing the Indians to be friendly, that they were not on
their guard. Had not the other Christians escaped to the
brigantine, they would all have been killed, because they
were entirely unarmed. The death of these Christians did
great harm to our reputation, for the Guaxarapos, who were
in the habit of coming in their canoes to the port of Los
Reyes, spread the news how they had slain the Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-&nbsp;207&nbsp;-</a></span>
asserting that we were not valiant, and that our heads were
soft, that the natives of that port ought to kill us, and that
they would help them to do this. From that time these
natives began to cherish evil designs against us.</p>

<h4>How the governor sent an expedition to the Xarayes.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">EIGHT</span> days after Antonio Correa and
Hector de Acu&ntilde;a, with their Indian
guides, had set out, as we have stated,
for the country and villages of the
Xarayes, they returned to the port
and told the governor what they had
seen, done, and learned about the country, the people, and
their chief. They brought with them an Indian whom the
chief of the Xarayes had sent as a guide for the discovery of
the land. Antonio Correa and Hector de Acu&ntilde;a said that,
the very day of their departure from the port of Los Reyes,
they arrived at a village of Indians called Artaneses, who
are big men, and go naked. These people are agriculturists,
but they sow little, for they have not much land fit for cultivation,
because most of it is inundated, and covered with
arid sand. They are poor, and subsist chiefly by fishing in
the lagoons near their villages. Their women are very ugly,
tattooing their faces with the tip of the ray&rsquo;s tail, which they
keep for this purpose, and they cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>These Indians are also hideous, owing to the habit they have
of piercing a hole in the lower lip, and inserting in it the husk
of a fruit of a certain tree, which is as large and round as a
<i>tortero</i>.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> This weighs down, and distends the lip in a manner
frightful to see. Antonio Correa and his companion reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-&nbsp;208&nbsp;-</a></span>
that the Indians had received them well, and had given them
what they had to eat. The next day they brought them a
guide. They had taken water to drink on their journey in
gourds, and had marched all that day through swamps,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> sinking
at each step to the knees in mud, and withdrawing their feet
with great difficulty. The mud was so heated by the sun
that it scorched their legs, and produced painful wounds on
them. That day they certainly thought they would have
died of thirst, for the water in the gourds only lasted half
the day. They slept on the open ground, between swamps,
overcome with fatigue, thirst, and hunger. The following
day, at eight in the morning, they came to a small lagoon of
very muddy water, where they refilled their gourds, which
the Indians carried, and marched the whole day through
inundated land, as they had done the day before, except that
they found some lagoon water with which to refresh themselves,
and a tree with a little shade, where they reposed,
and ate the remainder of their provisions, without leaving
anything over. The guides told them that they had still a
day&rsquo;s march before them to reach the settlements of the
Xarayes.</p>

</div>

<p>Night having come, they rested, and at daybreak resumed
their march. Soon afterwards they came to other swamps,
from which they thought they would never extricate themselves,
not only because of the painful burning of their legs,
but because they sank to the waist, and could hardly get out.
These swamps extended for a little over a league, and then
they found the way better and firmer. The same day, at one
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, having eaten nothing, and not having
the wherewithal to satisfy their hunger, they met some
twenty Indians who came towards them. These people
arrived with pleasure and joy, laden with maize, bread, cooked
geese, fish, and maize wine. They told the Spaniards that
their chief had learned of their coming to his country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">-&nbsp;209&nbsp;-</a></span>
had ordered them to bring food and speak to them on his
behalf, and guide them to where he and his people were, who
would be glad to receive them. Thanks to this food, Antonio
Correa and his companions made up for their previous
fasting. The same day, one hour before night, they arrived
at the Indian settlements.</p>

<p>When they were a bow-shot off, upwards of five hundred
Xarayes came forth to receive them with great joy. All
were elegantly attired with parrots&rsquo; feathers, and aprons of
white beads to cover their nakedness. They placed the
Spaniards in their midst, and led them into the village, at
the entrance to which large numbers of women and children
were waiting for them. The women all had their privities
covered, and many of them wore wide cotton dresses,
this material being in use among them under the name of
<i>tipoes</i>.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards had entered the village they came
to where the chief of the Xarayes was. He was surrounded
by three hundred Indians of very good appearance,
mostly elderly men. This chief was seated on a cotton
hammock in the midst of a large open place, all his people
standing round him. They formed a lane by which the
Spaniards might pass, and when these had come into the
presence of the chief, they brought two little wooden
stools, on which he signed to them to be seated. He
then sent for an Indian Guaran&iacute;, who had been long in
their country. This Indian had married a woman of their
tribe, and was much loved by them, and regarded as one
of themselves.</p>

<p>By means of this interpreter, the chief then bade the
Spaniards welcome, and said how delighted they all were
to see them, for he had long wished to know the Christians.
He had heard of them at the time of Garcia&rsquo;s visit to
that country, and looked upon them as friends and
relatives; he wished to make acquaintance with the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">-&nbsp;210&nbsp;-</a></span>
of the Christians, because he had been told that he was
kind and friendly with the Indians, that he gave them
presents, and was generous, and he wished to know if the
chief had sent them for anything, because he would give it
them. The Spaniards told him, through the interpreter,
that the governor had sent them to learn from him the
route he should follow to reach the settlements in the
interior, and to know by what tribes and villages he would
have to pass, and in how many days he might arrive at the
Indians that had gold and silver. They added that the
object of their journey was also to inform him that the
governor wished to make his acquaintance and contract an
alliance with him. They spoke of all that the governor
desired them to say. The Indian replied: &ldquo;I am rejoiced to
have you as my friends; I and my people consider the
governor as our master; he has only to command, and we
will obey him. Concerning the road leading to the settlements
of the interior, I do not know of one, never having
been there, because all the country is under water for two
months, and when the waters subside the country is impassable.
Nevertheless, the Indian Guaran&iacute;, who is serving as
interpreter, has been in the interior and knows the road; to
please the chief of the Christians I will send him to be his
guide.&rdquo; Thereupon, in the presence of all the people, he
bade the Guaran&iacute; accompany them, which he did very
willingly.</p>

<p>The Spaniards having seen that the chief denied that
there was a road, for reasons which seemed to them after
their experiences to be good and true, believed him. They
asked him, however, for guides to lead them to the Guaran&iacute;
settlements, because they were desirous of seeing and talking
with these people. At this request the Indian was much
troubled, and yet putting a good face on the matter, he
answered, that the Guaran&iacute;s were his enemies, and he was
constantly at war with them, and hardly a day passed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">-&nbsp;211&nbsp;-</a></span>
they did not kill one another; and that since he was the
friend of the Christians, they should not go in search of his
enemies and contract an alliance with them. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;if you will go and visit these Guaran&iacute;s, my people
will conduct you there to-morrow morning.&rdquo; As it was now
night, the chief took them into his house, and gave them to
eat, and had hammocks prepared for them. He then offered
each of them a girl to sleep with, but they declined on the
score of fatigue.</p>

<p>The following morning, one hour before daybreak, a great
noise of drums beating and trumpets was heard, as though
the whole village was falling about their ears. On the
square in front of the chief&rsquo;s house, all the Indians were
assembled in their feathers and war-paint, armed with bows
and arrows. Immediately the chief ordered the door of the
house to be thrown open, in order that they might see his
six hundred warriors, and he said to the Spaniards:
&ldquo;Christians, look at my people; it is thus they go to the
Guaran&iacute; villages; go with them; they will take you there,
and bring you back, for if you went alone they would kill
you, knowing that you have been with me, and are my
friends.&rdquo; The Spaniards, seeing that in this way they would
not have been able to speak with the chief of the Guaran&iacute;s,
and might lose the friendship of the Xarayes, answered that
they had made up their minds to return to their chief and
inform him of everything, and would see what he ordered,
and then return and let him know. In this way the Indians
were pacified. All that day they remained in the settlement
of the Xarayes, which contained over one thousand inhabitants,
and one league off there were four other villages
of the same people, all of whom obeyed the said chief, whose
name was Camire.</p>

<p>These Xarayes are tall men, and well made; they are
agriculturists, sowing and reaping twice a year maize,
potatoes, manioc, and mandubies. They rear large numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">-&nbsp;212&nbsp;-</a></span>
of geese and fowls like ours in Spain. They pierce the lip
like the Artaneses. Everyone lives separately with wife
and children; they hoe the ground and sow; the women
gather the produce and carry it to their houses; they spin
much cotton. These Indians rear geese to devour the
crickets, as we have before described.</p>

<h4>How the interpreters came back from the Xarayes.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THESE</span> Xarayes have large fisheries,
both in the river and lagoons; they
also chase the deer. The Spaniards
having remained the whole day with
the chief, gave him the presents and
red cap sent him by the governor.
The chief was marvellously well pleased to receive them.
He immediately sent for head-dresses of parrots&rsquo; feathers,
and gave these to the Christians to take to the governor;
these ornaments were very elegant. The Christians then
took leave of Camire, who ordered twenty of his Indians
to accompany them. These men went with them as far as
the settlements of the Artaneses, and then returned home,
leaving with the Spaniards the guide given them by the
chief. The governor received him well, showing him much
kindness, and at once asked him through interpreters if he
knew the road into the interior, to what tribe he belonged,
and about his country. He replied that he was a Guaran&iacute;,
a native of Itati, on the Paraguai; when he was a boy his
tribe made a great league of all the Indians of that country,
and marched into the interior. He followed his father and
relatives to make war upon the natives, and take from them
plates and ornaments of gold and silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">-&nbsp;213&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at the first settlements of the
interior they began making war, and slew many Indians. A
great number of the inhabitants took to flight, and sought
refuge in the villages farther inland. Very soon the tribes
of that inner land joined together, and came up against the
Guaran&iacute;s, defeated them, and slew many; others fled in
various directions. The enemy pursued and blocked the
passes, thus cutting off their retreat, and killed all those who
were unable to escape. He made signs to show that only two
hundred of that great multitude succeeded in making good
their escape, and he was of this number. The greater part
remained in the forests through which they had passed on
their way out, not daring to go farther for fear of being killed
by the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other tribes occupying those
parts which they would have to traverse. He did not remain
with those who settled in the forest region, but preferred
accompanying those of his countrymen who returned. One
night, as they were on the march, they were discovered by
the tribes, who set upon them, and killed all, he alone
escaping into the recesses of the forests, and, continuing his
march, arrived at the country of the Xarayes, who spared his
life and brought him up. They took a fancy to him, married
him to a woman of their own tribe, and treated him as one
of themselves. He was asked if he knew the road taken
by his people when they went into the interior. But he
said it was long ago that his countrymen advanced into that
country, and that as they went they opened a road, by cutting
down trees and clearing the ground, which was quite wild.
He thought that the roads then made would long ere this
have been choked with weeds, for he had never been that way
since. Nevertheless, he thought that if he once found the
road he might continue in it. He added that the road began
at a high, round mountain in sight of Port Los Reyes. He
was asked in how many days the first settlement would be
reached. He answered that, if his memory served him right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">-&nbsp;214&nbsp;-</a></span>
in five days they would arrive at the first settlement, where
provisions were plentiful, and the people great agriculturists;
for though his people that went to that war destroyed the
inhabitants, and depopulated vast tracts, the country was
beginning to recover. Asked if there were large rivers and
springs by the way, he answered that the rivers he saw were
not large, but there were other copious streams, and there
were springs and lakes, deer and tapirs, and plenty of honey
and fruits. To the question, if at the time when his people
made their expedition into that country he saw much gold
and silver among the natives, he answered that from those
tribes they had plundered much gold and silver plate,
<i>barbotes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> ear-rings, bracelets, crowns, hatchets, and small
vessels, but that these things had been retaken when
they were defeated; that those who escaped carried some
away, but that these were afterwards stolen by the
Guaxarapos, who killed them as they passed through their
territory. A little of the plunder probably remained with
those who settled in the forest region, and he had heard
that the Xarayes had some also, for when these Indians went
to war against other Indians, he had seen them returning
with plates of silver which they had captured. He was
asked if he would accompany the Christians as guide. He
answered yes, that he would gladly do so, and that his master
had sent him for that purpose. The governor warned him
to speak the truth concerning the road, for otherwise he
would have to pay dearly for it, but that if he spoke the
truth he would derive much benefit. He answered that
what he had said was the truth, as far as he knew, and that
he was desirous of going with the Christians to discover and
find out the way.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">HAVING</span> obtained this information, the
governor determined, in accordance
with the advice of the officers and
clergy and captains, to penetrate into
the interior and discover the settlements
there, and for this purpose he
chose three hundred arquebusiers and crossbowmen. As the
country through which they had to pass before they came to
the inhabited districts was deserted, he ordered them to take
provisions for twenty days. He ordered one hundred Christians
to remain in the port to guard the brigantines, with 200
Guaran&iacute;s, and appointed Captain Juan Romero to be their
commander, for he knew the country. We left the port of
Los Reyes on the 26th November 1543. All that day we
marched through cool and shady forests, following our guide
by a little frequented path. That night we rested by the
side of some streams of water, and the following morning,
one hour before daybreak, resumed our journey, sending
twenty men in advance with the guide to clear the road; for
the further we went the more closed we found it by trees
and high, thick weeds, rendering it very difficult to penetrate
into the interior. That same day, at five o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, we halted to pass the night by the side of a great
lagoon, where the Indians and Christians caught fish in their
hands. As we advanced, we ordered the guide to climb the
trees and hills to reconnoitre, and make certain we were on
the right road to the inhabited country.</p>

<p>The Guaran&iacute;s, whom the governor had brought with him,
supported themselves on the provisions they had been
allowed to take, on the honey they extracted from trees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">-&nbsp;216&nbsp;-</a></span>
by the chase of wild boar, tapirs, and deer. Though game
seemed plentiful, the expedition was so numerous, and the
noise made on the march was so great, that the wild animals
took fright, and not much was killed. The Indians and
Spaniards also partook of the wild fruits, found in abundance.
None of these did them any harm, except that of a
tree resembling the myrtle, with a fruit similar to that of the
Spanish myrtle, but a little larger, and with a fine flavour.
All those who ate of it vomited, or had diarrh&oelig;a. These
effects, however, did not last long, and did no further harm.
They also made use of the palm-tree, which is common in that
country. The date of this palm is not edible, but the nut
inside is round, and like a sweet almond. The Indians make
flour of it, and find it nourishing; the young shoots of the
palm are likewise very good eating.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WE</span> had marched five days in the country,
following our guide, always obliged
to cut our way with infinite labour,
when we came to a rivulet, which
falls from a mountain; its water is
very warm, clear, and sweet; and the
Spaniards caught some fish in it.
Here the guide began to be embarrassed, saying that as
it was a long time since he passed that way he did not
recognise it, and was at a loss how to guide us, the old
track having entirely disappeared. The next day the governor
left the Rio Caliente (river of warm water); and we
followed the guide with great trouble, cutting our way
through forest, brushwood, and a multitude of obstacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">-&nbsp;217&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>That same day, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, two Indian
Guaran&iacute;s presented themselves before him, and said they
were some of those who had remained in those deserts after
the wars waged by their tribesmen against the people in the
interior, when they were defeated and massacred. They and
their wives and children had concealed themselves in the
most inaccessible parts of the forest for fear of the natives,
and only fourteen of them survived; that at two days&rsquo; journey
there was a hamlet of Guaran&iacute;s, numbering ten persons, one
of whom was a relative of theirs, and that there were other
Guaran&iacute;s in the country of the Xarayes, who were at war with
this people. As these Indians seemed frightened of the Christians
and their horses, the governor ordered the interpreter
to reassure them, and asked them where they dwelt; they
answered that their homes were close by, and soon their
wives and children arrived with others of their relatives,
who may have numbered fourteen in all. These confirmed
what the first two had said. On being asked how they
supported themselves in that country, and how long they
had inhabited it, they answered that they cultivated maize,
and lived by the chase, on honey and wild fruits, and
that when their fathers were killed they were children.
The oldest of them might have been about thirty-five
years of age. They were asked if they knew the way
thence to the settlements of the interior, and how long it
would take to arrive at the inhabited land. They answered
that as they were very young when they were brought there,
and had never made the journey since, they were unable to
direct us how to go, nor could they say how long it would
take to arrive at that region. But they added, their relatives,
who lived in the hamlet, two days&rsquo; journey from theirs, had
passed several times by that road, and knew it. Perceiving
that these Indians did not know the road, the governor told
them to go home, and dismissed them with presents, with
which they returned to their homes well satisfied.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> following day the governor sent an
interpreter with two Spaniards and two
Indians to the house of which mention
has been made, to ascertain the road
and the time it would take to reach the
first inhabited parts. He ordered that
they should report as promptly as possible to him any
information they were able to obtain, in order that he might
take measures accordingly. The day after the departure of
these scouts he ordered his people to follow by short marches
the route they had taken. When they had thus been marching
three days an Indian arrived, bearing a letter for the
governor from the interpreter, saying that he had arrived
at the house of the Indians, and had spoken with the man
who knew the road into the interior. This man had told
him that the first inhabited place was the summit of a rocky
hill called <i>Tapuaguaz&uacute;</i>, that on reaching it a view might
be obtained of a wide extent of inhabited country, and that
it might be sixteen days&rsquo; journey from his place to Tapuaguaz&uacute;,
and that the road thither was very difficult because
of the trees, thickets, and high grass, besides other inconveniences.
The interpreter added that since leaving the
governor they had found the country thickly forested and
so difficult that they had undergone great fatigues. For
the greater part of the way they had crawled on hands and
feet, and, according to the Indian relative, the road farther
on was even worse. They intended bringing this Indian
back with them that the governor might obtain information
direct from him. Having read this letter, the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-&nbsp;219&nbsp;-</a></span>
followed the path by which the messenger had come, but
found it so thickly wooded and beset with difficulties that it
took a whole day to clear a passage the length of a slinger&rsquo;s
shot. Heavy rains having now set in, the governor ordered
his people to retire to the shelter huts they had left in the
morning, for fear of their suffering from wet and damping
their ammunition.</p>

<h4>How the interpreter returned from the Indian habitation.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> interpreter returned at three o&rsquo;clock
of the afternoon of the following day,
bringing with him the Indian who said
he knew the road. The governor received
him most kindly and gave him
presents, with which he was well pleased.
He then ordered the interpreter to ask him in his name to
tell him all the truth about the road leading into the interior.
This Indian then said that he had not been that way for
a long time, though he knew it, and had gone by it several
times to Tapuaguaz&uacute;. From the summit of that rocky hill,
he affirmed, one might see the smoke of all the villages. He
used to go to Tapuaguaz&uacute; to fetch arrows that are to be had
there, but for many days he had discontinued his visits to
that place, because on his way thither he observed the
smoke of Indian fires, by which he became aware that new
settlements were being formed in that deserted region.</p>

<p>Fearing for his life, he had not dared to go further along
the path, which is so obstructed that it can only be followed
with much labour. He thought that by cutting down trees
and clearing a road they might reach Tapuaguaz&uacute; in sixteen
days. He was asked if he would like to accompany the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">-&nbsp;220&nbsp;-</a></span>
Christians and show them the road; he answered that he would
willingly go, though he greatly feared the natives. Having
heard the information given by this Indian, and understood
the difficulties of the road, the governor convened a meeting
of the officers, clergy, and captains to consult with them
what should be done to discover the country. Having
discussed the matter, they said that most of the Spaniards
were in want of provisions and had eaten nothing for three
days, and they dared not ask for it because of the disorder
and mismanagement that prevailed in its distribution. The
first guide we had taken had assured us that on the fifth
day we should find provisions and reach an inhabited country
with plenty of commodities. Having put faith in these
promises, both Christians and Indians had improvidently consumed
all they brought with them, though every man had
been supplied with two arrobas of flour. The governor had,
in their opinion, to consider that there were barely six days&rsquo;
provisions left, and at the end of that time there would
be nothing for the people to eat. Under these circumstances
they thought it would be very dangerous to advance
further without means of subsistence, the more so because
the Indians are not as a rule precise in their indications,
and it might happen that, instead of sixteen days estimated
by the guide, the time might be greater, and that they might
all die of starvation, as had happened before to exploring
expeditions in this country. They were, therefore, of opinion
that the security and lives of the Christians and Indians
depended upon their return to the port of Los Reyes, where
they had left their vessels. Once there, it would be easy to
take fresh supplies and recommence the discovery. Such was
their advice, and, they added, if necessary, they would require
the governor in the name of His Majesty to conform with it.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor seeing the advice of the
clergy, officers, and captains, felt obliged
to consider the necessities of his people,
their difficult position, and the desire
all had to return. He nevertheless
put before them the inconvenience that
would result from adopting such a course. He said that it
would be impossible to find sufficient provisions at Los Reyes
for so many people; that the maize was not yet ripe for
harvest, and that none could be obtained from the natives.
He reminded them that the natives had told them that the
floods would soon begin, and these would add seriously to
their embarrassments. These and other reasons pointed out
by him, however, did not deter the Spaniards from persisting
in their determination to retire. Considering, therefore, their
positive wish, and being loath to give occasion to disturbances,
which he would have been obliged to punish, he
conceded to their desires, and gave the order to return to
the Port of Los Reyes.</p>

<p>The following day he sent to Tapu&aacute; Captain Francisco
de Ribera, who had volunteered to go thither with six
Christians and the guide who knew the road. He furnished
him with an escort of eleven Indian chiefs, whom he
charged not to leave the captain under threat of punishment.
He at the same time started with all his people for Los
Reyes, where he arrived in eight days, much dissatisfied at
having gone no farther.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHEN</span> the governor had returned to the
Port of Los Reyes, Captain Juan
Romero, whom he had left there as his
lieutenant, reported that a few days
after his departure the natives of the
island, which is one league from the
port, conspired to massacre all the
Christians who had been left there, and to obtain possession
of the brigantines. To carry this into effect, they summoned
all the natives of the country to their assistance. They
formed a league with the Guaxarapos and several other tribes,
and had arranged to attack the Spaniards by night. Under
pretext of bartering they tried to tempt him to come out
and buy provisions, they having discontinued their supplies.
Whenever they brought any it was for the purpose of spying,
and they openly told him they would come and kill the
Christians.</p>

<p>The governor having been informed of all this, summoned
all the chiefs, and warned them in the name of His Majesty
to keep the peace, since he and the Christians had treated
them as friends, and were doing them no injury. He
reminded them of the presents he had given them, and of
his promise to defend and protect them from their enemies;
but if they behaved otherwise he would treat them as
enemies, and make war upon them. These threats were
made in the presence of the clergy and officers; he then
distributed coloured caps among them, besides other things.
They promised once more to keep friends with the Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-&nbsp;223&nbsp;-</a></span>
and drive away the Guaxarapos and other tribes who came
up against the Christians.</p>

<p>Two days after his arrival at Los Reyes, the governor
finding that with so many Spaniards and Indians collected
together he might run short of provisions, and having no other
store except what was contained in the brigantines moored
in the river, and this would only last ten or twelve days,
for the Spaniards and Indians together numbered about
three thousand, seeing their necessities and the danger of
their all being starved, sent all the interpreters to the neighbouring
villages to buy provisions in exchange for merchandise,
which he gave them in considerable quantities. They
went, but found no provisions. Having seen this, the
governor sent for the chief Indians of that land, and asked
them where he could buy provisions in exchange for his
merchandise. They answered that at nine leagues distance,
on the shores of certain large lagoons, there lived a people
called Arianicosies, who possessed an abundance of provisions,
and would supply what was necessary.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AS</span> soon as the governor had received this
information he convoked a meeting of
officers, clergy, and captains, and other
experienced persons, to concert measures
with them, for all the people were crying
for food, and he had none to give them.
They were about to disband, and go into
the interior in search of provisions. The officers and the clergy
being assembled, Cabeza de Vaca told them that the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">-&nbsp;224&nbsp;-</a></span>
of famine was so urgent that all might die if a remedy were
not found. He added that he had been informed that the
Arianicosies had provisions, and he asked them to advise him
what should be done. They all answered that he should
send the greater part of the people to the villages of those
Indians, both to sustain themselves and obtain provisions to
send to the people that remained in the port with him.
Should they decline to supply food for payment, force should
be resorted to, and, in case of resistance, they should make
war till they obtained what they required, seeing that the
necessities were so urgent that the people were dying with
hunger, and any measures would be excusable. This was
their advice, and they signed their names to it. It was
accordingly resolved to send this captain in search of provisions,
charged with the following instructions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">-&nbsp;225&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Gonzalo de Mendoza, this is what you have to
do in the villages where you have to search for provisions,
in order that our people may not die from starvation. You
shall pay for these provisions to the full satisfaction of
Socorinos and Socosies, as well as all those settled in the
province, and you shall say in my name that I am surprised
they have not been to see me, as the other tribes of the
province have done; that I am informed they are good
people, and for this reason I wish to see and receive them
into my friendship. You shall give them of my merchandise,
and tell them to come and acknowledge the supremacy
of the king, as all the other Indians have done. If they
obey these orders, I will always favour and protect them
against those who would do them wrong. You shall use
the utmost diligence and care that, in all places you may
pass through inhabited by friendly Indians, none of your
men should use violence, or maltreat the natives. All that
you take, and all that they give you, must be paid for to
their satisfaction, and leave no cause of complaint. When
you arrive at the villages you shall ask for the commodities
you require for the sustenance of your men, offering payment,
and entreating the Indians with kind words. Should they
decline to provide you with what you want, you shall repeat
your request twice, thrice, or as often as you think right, offering
payment beforehand. Should they then refuse to give it,
you shall take it by force, and, if resistance be offered you,
shall make war upon them, for the hunger we suffer from
justifies us in resorting to these extreme measures. In all
that may happen afterwards you shall use such moderation
as becomes the service of God and His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor having sent Captain
Gonzalo de Mendoza in conformity
with the advice of the clergy, officers,
and captains, this officer departed on
the 15th December, the same year, with
120 Spaniards and 600 Indian archers,
a number more than sufficient for the purpose. The natives
of the port of Los Reyes informed the governor that owing
to the rising of the waters the river Yguat&uacute; might be ascended
in brigantines as far as the land of the Xarayes; they told
him that these Xarayes, and other tribes inhabiting the
banks of that river, had a quantity of provisions, and that
there were other navigable rivers flowing from the interior,
and discharging into the Yguat&uacute;, where there were large
settlements of Indians, who had abundance of food.
Desirous of exploring the unknown parts of this river, the
governor sent Captain Hernando de Ribera in a brigantine
with fifty-two men. They had orders to ascend the river to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-&nbsp;226&nbsp;-</a></span>
the villages of the Xarayes, to speak with the chief of this
tribe, and obtain information about the more distant villages,
passing on and seeing them with their own eyes. Neither
the commander nor any of his men were to land, but the
interpreter with two men might endeavour to see and barter
with the Indians along the course of the river, giving
presents, and making them proposals of peace. For this
purpose the governor furnished the commander with
instructions, and informed him by word of mouth of
everything that he should do for the service of His
Majesty and the good of the country. Hernando de
Ribera set sail on the 20th December of the said year.</p>

<p>A few days after his departure Captain Gonzalo de
Mendoza wrote to say that on his arrival at the villages of
the Arianicosies he had sent an interpreter to inform them
that he had come to ask them to sell provisions, which he
would pay for with merchandise, such as beads, knives, iron
wedges, which they esteem highly, and that he would give
them a large number of fish-hooks. The interpreter took
these articles with him in order that they might see and
understand that they had not come to do them wrong, or
take anything away by force; but that the interpreter had
fled back, for that the natives had tried to kill him, and shot
several arrows at him, saying that they would not allow any
Christians in their land, and would not give them anything,
but would rather kill them all, and that the Guaxarapos, who
were brave warriors, had come to help them. These last-named
Indians, they added, have killed Christians, and
found their heads soft, and that they are not a strong people.
The letter went on to say that Gonzalo de Mendoza had sent
a second time the same interpreter to beg them to supply
him with provisions. He had sent with him some Spaniards
to see what passed. All these returned, being pursued by
Indians, who had come out with arms to kill them, and had
shot a number of arrows at them, shouting to them to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">-&nbsp;227&nbsp;-</a></span>
the country, as they would not give them provisions. The
captain having seen all this, had gone with all his troop to
bring about their submission; on arriving at their village all
the Indians had come out against him, and shot arrows at
them, intending to kill the Spaniards, declining to listen to
him or let him speak. They had consequently, in their own
defence, killed two of the natives with their arquebuses.
As soon as the enemy saw them dead, they fled into the
forest. The Spaniards then went into their houses, and
found an abundance of provisions, such as maize, mandubies
and other plants, roots, and other comestibles.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, Gonzalo de Mendoza sent an Indian
to tell the natives to return to their homes, promising to be
friendly with them, and to pay for the provisions he had
taken. They had refused, however, to accept his peaceful
overtures, had recommenced hostilities, established their
camp, fortified their houses, and had even burned a great
number of these. They had appealed to many other tribes
to come and help them to kill the Christians, and did not
desist from doing them all the harm they could. The
governor sent orders to the captain to do everything in his
power to induce the Indians to return; he enjoined him not
to let any of his men do the least harm to the natives, to pay
for all the provisions he had taken, to pacify them, and go elsewhere
in search of provisions. The captain soon afterwards
reported that he had persuaded the Indians to return, had
offered them his friendship, and, far from injuring them,
would treat them kindly; they had, however, declined his
advances, and were continuing hostilities in conjunction
with the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other of our enemies who
were in league with them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 20th January 1544, Captain

by the six Spaniards whom

the guide and three Guaran&iacute;s, being
all that were left of the eleven

said, to discover and observe with his own eyes the villages
situated in that part where the governor was obliged
to turn back. They had advanced towards Tapuaguaz&uacute;,
where the guide had stated the Indian settlements began.
On the arrival of the six Spaniards, all of whom were
wounded, the people rejoiced greatly and gave thanks
to God for their escape from such a perilous journey,
for, indeed, the governor thought they were lost, because
eight of the eleven Indians that started with them had
abandoned them. He was very angry with these men and
wished to punish them, and the chiefs, their relatives, begged
that they might be hanged for having deserted the Christians,
though they had been ordered not to leave them, and to
escort them till they returned. These chiefs said that since
they had failed to do this they deserved hanging, but as it
was the first time they had disobeyed he pardoned them,
fearing to excite their tribesmen.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> following day Captain Francisco de
Ribera appeared before the governor
with the six other Spaniards who had
accompanied him. He gave an account
of his exploration, and said: that after
he left him in the forest he marched,
following the guide for twenty-one days, without resting,
through a country so thickly covered with trees and brushwood
that it was impossible to advance without cutting a
path. Some days they went one league, on others only half
a league in two days, owing to the obstacles they encountered,
the dense forests, and projecting rocks. The direction they
followed was continually west; all the time they marched
they sustained themselves on venison, wild boars&rsquo; flesh, and
tapirs, which the Indians killed with their arrows; game was
so abundant that they knocked down with sticks all they
required for food. They found a great supply of honey in
cavities of trees, and quantities of wild fruit. After twenty-one
days they arrived at a river running to the west, and
this river, according to their guide, flowed past Tapuaguaz&uacute;
and the Indian settlements. They caught much fish in it of
a kind called by the natives <i>piraputanas</i>, which are a kind of
<i>sabalos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and are excellent. The Spaniards crossed this river,
and, following their guide, came upon the fresh tracks of
Indians; for it had been raining that day, and the ground was
moist. It was evident that the Indians were a party of
hunters. Following their footprints, they came upon two
large stacks of maize which was then being harvested. At
this moment an Indian, who had not time to conceal himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">-&nbsp;230&nbsp;-</a></span>
came towards them. He spoke a language they could
not understand, wore a large silver disc in his lower lip, and
gold earrings. He took Francisco de Ribera by the hand
and signed to him to accompany him, which he did. They
now observed a large house made of straw and wood. On
approaching it, they saw women and other Indians carrying
out of the house cotton stuffs and other articles, which they
placed in front of the stacks. The Indian made them enter
the house, where men and women were carrying out all it
contained. In order to avoid passing the Christians, they
made an opening in the straw, and passed the things out that
way. Our people saw them taking from some large vessels
full of maize, plates, hatchets, and bracelets of silver which
they carried outside the straw walls. This Indian appeared
to be the head of the family from the respect shown him.
He took them inside, and signed to them to be seated, and
ordered two <i>Orejones</i> (Indians with large ears), whom they
supposed to be his slaves, to give them maize wine to drink
out of some jars, which stood in the house buried up to their
necks in the earth. They poured the wine into large gourds,
and handed these to the Spaniards. The two Orejones said
that at three days&rsquo; journey from that place there were Christians
living with a tribe called Payzunoes; they then told
the way to Tapuaguaz&uacute;, which is a high mountain. Soon
many natives arrived in their war-paint and feathers, with
bows and arrows. The Indian spoke very volubly to them,
and he also took a bow and arrows; he sent men, who came
and went, with messages, by which the Spaniards knew that
he was summoning the population from the neighbouring
villages, and intended killing them. The captain told the
Christians who were with him to come out of the house
altogether, and return by the way they came, before more
Indians had assembled; by this time there were over
three hundred. Ribera gave the natives to understand
that he would go and fetch many other Christians who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-&nbsp;231&nbsp;-</a></span>
were close at hand, and, as they were expecting more to
arrive, they had only to wait till he came back. By this ruse
our people escaped, but, at a stone&rsquo;s throw from the house,
the Indians, who saw they were escaping, pursued them with
cries, and shot many arrows at them. They followed them into
the forest, where the Christians defended themselves, and the
Indians, thinking there were a larger number of them here,
durst not pursue further, but let them go; all the Spaniards,
however, were wounded. They came back the way they went,
and it took them only twelve days to return to the place
where they had left the governor, whence they had marched
in twenty-one days. The captain estimated the distance from
the Port of Los Reyes to the villages of those Indians at
seventy leagues.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>A lagoon twenty leagues from this port, in crossing which
they had the water knee-deep, was, upon their return, so
greatly increased that it covered a league of land, and
was two pikes deep. They crossed it in rafts with great
danger and difficulty. The captain added that, before
attempting to enter that country, it would be necessary to
wait till the waters subsided. The Indians he had seen were
called <i>Tarapecosies</i>; they have plenty of provisions, and they
rear geese and poultry like ours. This was the account
given by Francisco de Ribera and by the Spaniards who
accompanied him, and by the guide, all of whom confirmed
what Francisco de Ribera had said.</p>

<p>There were some Indians in the port of Los Reyes belonging
to the same tribe of Tarapecosies, from whose village
de Ribera had just returned. They had come with Garcia,
the interpreter, when he made his journey into the interior
and returned defeated by the Guaran&iacute;s of the Paraguai.
These Indians had escaped with the Chaneses, who had also
fled and lived all together in the port of Los Reyes. The
governor, wishing for further information, sent for them.
They immediately recognised the arrows that Francisco de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-&nbsp;232&nbsp;-</a></span>
Ribera had brought with him, which had been shot at him
by the Tarapecosies, as those used in their native country.
The governor asked them why their fellow-tribesmen had
wished to kill those who had gone to see them. They
answered that the Tarapecosies were no enemies of the
Christians; on the contrary, they were their friends since
Garcia had visited their country and trafficked with them.
The reason why they had tried to kill the Spaniards was
because these had taken Guaran&iacute;s with them whom they regarded
as enemies; for in former times these people had invaded
their territory and sought to destroy them. The Christians,
they said, should have taken an interpreter with them who
knew their language, to let them know the object of their
visit, for they were not in the habit of making war upon
those who did them no injury. If they take an interpreter,
they added, they will be well treated and supplied with
provisions, and gold and silver, which are obtained from
the tribes of the interior. Asked from what tribe and
how they acquired their gold and silver, they answered
that the Payzunos, who lived three days&rsquo; journey off, gave
them these precious metals in exchange for bows and
arrows and slaves, which they took from other tribes; the
Payzunos obtained them from the Chaneses, Chimenos, Carcaraes,
Candir&eacute;es, and other Indian nations who possess an
abundance of them. They were shown a brass candlestick
very bright and shiny, to see if the gold they had in their
land was like that. They said that the metal of the candlestick
was hard and base, but their metal was soft and without
smell, and more yellow. Then they were shown a gold ring,
and asked if that were the metal of their country, and they
said it was. They were also shown a tin plate, very bright
and shiny, and asked if the silver in their country was of that
kind. They answered that this metal stank, and was base
and soft; theirs was whiter, harder, and had no bad smell.
A silver cup was then put in their hands, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-&nbsp;233&nbsp;-</a></span>
greatly pleased with it, and said that of that metal they had
quantities in their land in the form of small vases and other
things in use among the Indians, such as plates, bracelets,
crowns, small hatchets, and other objects.</p>

<h4>How the governor sent for Gonzalo de Mendoza.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor, in order to provide what
was necessary for the exploration of
this country as it beseemed the service
of His Majesty, sent, without delay, for
Gonzalo de Mendoza to recall him and
his men from the land of the Arianicosies.
Before leaving their village, however, he was to
endeavour to get the Indians to return to their houses and
pacify them.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Francisco de Ribera and his six
Spaniards at the port of Los Reyes, all the people there
began to suffer from fevers, so that there were not sufficient
men to mount guard in camp. Even the Guaran&iacute;s were sick
of this malady, and several died.</p>

<p>Gonzalo de Mendoza wrote that all his people were also
ill of the fever, and that he was sending in the brigantines
all the sick and infirm. He had not been able to make
peace with the Arianicosies, though he had several times made
friendly overtures and offered them presents. Yet in spite
of this they came every day and attacked him. The country,
he said, abounded in provisions, both in the fields and lakes.
Besides the provisions he had sent in the brigantines, a large
quantity was left for the natives. The sickness that had
attacked all the people was attributable to the pollution of
the water, which had become brackish as it rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">-&nbsp;234&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>About this time the Indians living in an island about one
league from port Los Reyes, who are called Socorinos and
Xaqueses, seeing how sick and weak the Christians were,
began to make war upon them. They no longer came
to traffic and barter with the Christians as they had
hitherto done, nor informed them of the evil designs of the
Guaxarapos; they even joined these latter, and prepared for
a campaign against the Spaniards. The Indian Guaran&iacute;s whom
the Spaniards had brought in their armada were in the habit
of going out in their canoes, in company with some Christians,
to fish in the lagoon, a stone&rsquo;s-throw from the camp. One
morning five Christians, four of whom were boys, had gone
in the canoes with these Guaran&iacute;s, when the Xaqueses,
Socorinos, and many other Indians of that island, came out
and captured the five Christians, killed the newly-converted
among the Guaran&iacute;s, and brought the rest to their island,
where they hacked the five Christians in pieces and distributed
them among the Guaxarapos, Guatos, and other natives
of the environs of port <i>Viejo</i> (the ancient). Other tribes,
who were associated with them for the purpose of making
war upon the Christians, had their share of the flesh of these
unfortunate people. Not content with this, as the people
were ill and weak, they came with great daring to attack the
settlement where the Christians were, and set fire to it.
These shouted, &ldquo;To arms, to arms, the Indians are killing
the Christians.&rdquo; As the whole settlement was now under
arms, they went out to meet the Indians, who, nevertheless,
succeeded in capturing more Christians, and among them one
called Pedro Mepen, and some others who were fishing in
the lagoon, and ate these as they had done the first five.</p>

<p>The following morning at daybreak a large number of
canoes were seen filled by warriors, who were running away
to the opposite side of the lagoon; they uttered loud
cries, pointed their bows and arrows, and held them up
to make us understand that they had made the assault.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">-&nbsp;235&nbsp;-</a></span>
They penetrated into the island situated in the lagoon
of Los Reyes, and killed this time fifty-eight Christians.
The governor having witnessed this disaster, told the
natives of the port of Los Reyes to demand from the Indians
of the island the release of the Christians they had captured.
These people having gone and demanded their release, were
told that the Guaxarapos had taken the prisoners away. From
that time they continually came at night, made incursions
on the lagoon to see if they might capture any Christians
or Indians fishing there, so as to prevent their fishing; for
they declared the land was theirs and that the Christians
had no right to fish there; that we must leave the country,
otherwise they would kill us. The governor sent to try and
appease them, and to tell them to keep the peace they had
made, and restore the Christian and Indian captives they had
taken, promising in such case to treat them as friends, but
that if they refused, he would act against them as enemies.
He repeated this message several times, but they would not
submit, and did not cease hostilities, and doing us all the
mischief they could. Seeing these measures were of no avail,
the governor ordered that an inquiry should be held, and
when this had been done in accordance with the advice of the
officers and clergy, these people were proclaimed enemies,
war was declared against them, and the country was protected
from the ravages daily committed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">ON</span> the 30th January 1543, Captain
Hernando de Ribera returned with
the vessel and men entrusted to him
for the exploration of the higher
reaches of the river. But when he
returned he found the governor and
all his people sick with fever and
shivering fits, so he could not make his report.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> By that
time the water in the river had so swollen that all the land
was inundated, and it was impossible to renew the exploration.
The natives say that the floods continue for four months, and
rise five or six fathoms, and that they then enter their canoes
with their houses and provisions, as I have related above, and
are not able to land. The natives of this country kill and eat
one another. When the waters subside they set up their
houses again on shore in the same places as before. The
land is about this time infected with malaria, arising from
the putrefaction of fish, which are left in large numbers on
the dry land, and with the high temperature then prevailing
it is impossible to endure the stench.</p>

<h4>What befell the governor and his people in the port of
Los Reyes.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> governor remained three months in
this port of Los Reyes with all his
people ill with fever, waiting till God
should be pleased to restore them to
health, and the waters should subside
to enable them to undertake the exploration
of the country. But every day the sickness
increased and the waters rose. We were, therefore, obliged
to withdraw from the port of Los Reyes in great trouble.
Besides the illness by which we were attacked, there were so
many mosquitoes of various kinds that we could neither sleep
nor rest day and night; the sufferings we endured from this
plague were even worse than the fever. Because of these
inconveniences, and as the officers had requested him
to abandon the port and to return to the city of Ascension,
where the people could recover, the governor having
referred to the clergy and officers, decided on withdrawing.
Yet he would not allow the Christians to take
with them about a hundred girls, whom the natives of
Los Reyes, upon the governor&rsquo;s arrival, had offered to the
captains and officers of distinction, so as to be on good
terms with them, leaving them to do what they pleased with
the girls. The motive of this refusal was to avoid the offence
against God done in this way. He ordered, at the moment
of departure, the fathers of these girls to receive them back
into their houses till our return, being unwilling that their
parents should be dissatisfied and the country scandalised
because of this. To give more importance to this action of
his, he published a rescript of His Majesty, forbidding, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">-&nbsp;238&nbsp;-</a></span>
the severest penalty, anybody from removing natives from
their homes. The natives were well satisfied with this
measure, but the Spaniards were greatly discontented, some
of them felt ill-disposed towards him, and from that time he
was detested by the majority. This was the motive or pretext
for their subsequent conduct, as I shall relate further on. All
the people, Christians and Indians, having embarked, he came
in twelve days to the port of Ascension, though it had taken
two months to ascend the same way. Though sick to death, the
people derived strength from their desire to return home.
The perils and difficulties of this voyage were certainly not
light, for the men were not strong enough to handle their arms
to resist the enemy, or make use of an oar to help to steer the
vessels; and had it not been for the culverins we carried, our
trouble would have been greater. We drew the canoes of the
Indians into the midst of the brigantines to protect them
from the enemy&rsquo;s attacks till we came to their homes, and
for better security the governor distributed some Christians
in the canoes.</p>

<p>We took every precaution, and kept a sharp look-out for
the enemy, when, as we were passing the lands of the
Guaxarapos, these natives attacked us suddenly with a
number of canoes. They assailed some rafts that were being
taken in reserve, and wounded a Christian with a dart, which
pierced him in the breast, so that he fell dead on the spot.
His name was Miranda, and he came from Valladolid. They
also wounded some of our Indians, and would have caused us
more losses had it not been for our culverins. The weakness
of the soldiers was the cause of it.</p>

<p>On the 8th April of the same year we arrived at the town
of Ascension with our troops, our Guaran&iacute;s, and our vessels.
The Governor and the Christians that were with him were all
sick and weak. On his arrival, Captain Salazar told him
that he had assembled over 20,000 Indians and a large
number of canoes to go out against the Agaces, for, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">-&nbsp;239&nbsp;-</a></span>
departure of the governor, they had not ceased making war
upon the Christians and the natives, plundering and slaying
them, taking from them wives and children, burning villages
and committing every kind of excess. When the governor
arrived, the expedition to punish the Agaces had not
yet started. We found the caravel ordered by the governor
nearly finished. He had intended sending it, as soon as it
was ready, to bear information to His Majesty of all that
had happened in his voyage of discovery and all that had
passed in the country. Orders were now given to complete
the caravel.</p>

<h4>How the governor, having arrived with his people at the town
of Ascension, was made a prisoner.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_f.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">FIFTEEN</span> days after the arrival of the
governor at Ascension, the officers of
His Majesty, who hated him because
he refused to consent to things done
against the service of God and the
king, seeing him arrive with the other
Christians in this extremity, conspired with their friends on
St. Mark&rsquo;s Day to take him prisoner that night. They had
already depopulated the best and principal port of the province,
with the intention of rebelling against the sovereign, as
they have now done. In order to carry out their plans in the
most effective way, they told a hundred men that they knew
the governor was about to take from them their property,
their houses, and their Indian girls, and would distribute these
among the men who had returned from the exploring expedition;
that it was a great injustice and contrary to the service
of His Majesty. &ldquo;This night&rdquo;, they added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">-&nbsp;240&nbsp;-</a></span> &ldquo;we will go and
require him, in the name of the king, not to take away your
houses, nor your lands, nor your Indian girls, and, as we fear
the governor may have us arrested, arm yourselves and bring
your friends, for you will be doing a great service to His
Majesty in this way.&rdquo; It was arranged that at the Ave
Maria these men should come armed to two houses which
would be assigned to them, and should hold themselves in
readiness there for further orders. So the insurgents, ten or
twelve in number, entered the apartment where the governor
was lying on his bed of sickness, with cries of &ldquo;Liberty, liberty,
long live the king!&rdquo; They were the supervisor Alonso
Cabrera, the accountant Philip de Caceres, Garcia Vanegas,
acting treasurer, a servant of the governor named Pedro
de O&ntilde;ate (who was in the room with him, opened the door to
the conspirators, and was an active promoter of the insurrection),
Don Francisco de Mendoza, Jaime Rasquin (who held
an arquebus and a poisoned dart at his breast), Diego de
Acosta, Portuguese interpreter, and Solorzano, a native of
Canaria. These men entered with arms in their hands and
seized the governor, dragged him out of the room in his
shirt, continuing to cry: &ldquo;Liberty, liberty!&rdquo; They called
him a tyrant, levelled their arquebuses at him, saying such
words as these: &ldquo;Now you shall pay the penalty of your
offences and the losses you have caused us.&rdquo; When they
had come out into the street they were joined by others
whom they had enlisted on their side, who, seeing they were
carrying the governor off a prisoner in that fashion, said to
Pedro Dorantes and the others: &ldquo;Let the responsibility of
this rest with the traitors who did the deed; you brought us
here on the pretext that our goods, houses, and Indian girls
would be taken from us, but your real object was to make us
parties to your treason against the king&rdquo;; upon this they drew
their swords, and there was a serious scrimmage. As the insurgents
were now approaching the houses of the officers some
took refuge in the house of Garcia Vanegas, dragging the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">-&nbsp;241&nbsp;-</a></span>
governor along with them. Others remained at the door,
saying to those who had taken the part of the governor: &ldquo;You
are betraying us; don&rsquo;t say that you did not know what
was going to be done; help us to put him into prison. If
you attempt to deliver him we will cut you to pieces and
chop off your heads. It is a matter of life and death to
you; aid us, therefore, to complete what we have begun,
and we will all share the goods, the Indian girls, and furniture
of the governor.&rdquo; The officers then entered the small room
in which the governor was confined, placed him in irons, and
set a watch upon him. Having done this they repaired to
the house of Juan Pavon, alcalde mayor, and to that of the
alguazil, Francisco de Peralta. When they had come to the
alcalde mayor&rsquo;s, Martin de Ure, a Biscayan, as leader, seized
by force the staff of office. They did the same at the
alguazil&rsquo;s, and, having struck these functionaries several
blows with the fist and knocked them about, they called
them traitors and took them to the public prison, where
they were put in the stocks by the head. They set at
liberty the prisoners, among whom was one sentenced to
death for having murdered a certain Morales, a gentleman
of Seville. Having done this, they took a drum and marched
about the streets, exciting the people to rebel, and uttering
loud cries of &ldquo;Liberty, liberty! Long live the king!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they had made the circuit of the city in this way,
the same individuals went to the house of Pero Hernandez,
secretary of the province, who was ill at the time. They
arrested him, as well as Bartolom&eacute; Gonzales, took possession
of his property and documents, and carried him prisoner to
the house of Domingo de Irala, where they placed him in
chains, and, after insulting him, left him in the hands of the
sentinels. Then they published the following proclamation:
&ldquo;The officers of His Majesty prohibit all persons from
appearing in the streets; anyone going out of doors will be
considered a traitor and condemned to death.&rdquo; Having done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">-&nbsp;242&nbsp;-</a></span>
this they again shouted, &ldquo;Liberty, liberty!&rdquo; While posting
this order, they pushed and hustled everyone they met in
the streets, forcing people to enter their houses.</p>

<p>They then went to the house of the governor, where he
kept his property, papers, and the letters he had received
from the king appointing him governor of the province, as
well as the acts by which his authority had been recognised.
They forced open some chests, extracted all the documents
contained in them, and took possession of everything. They
also opened a chest, locked with three keys, containing the
public indictments against officers charged with crimes
referred to the king for final sentence. They took also his
goods, stuffs, provisions, oil, steel, and iron, besides a number
of other things. Most of these things disappeared, everything
being looted. They denounced him as a tyrant, and
abused him in every way. The remainder of his property
was bestowed upon such as professed to be attached to him,
who took them under pretext of deposit; but these so-called
friends of the deposed governor really helped the insurgents.
His property was said to be worth over 100,000 castellanos,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
according to the value current then; he had also ten
brigantines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_358_358" id="Footnote_358_358" href="#FNanchor_358_358"><span class="label">[358]</span></a> A gold coin formerly in use in Spain. During the reign of the
Catholic kings it was worth 490 maravedis of silver, equal to about
4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> The value of these coins afterwards fluctuated. This sum
is undoubtedly grossly exaggerated.</p>

<h4>How the population assembled before the house of Domingo
de Irala.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> following day the officers published
in the streets, by sound of drum and
trumpet, that all the people should assemble
in front of the house of Captain
Domingo de Irala. Their friends and
partisans having gone there armed, a
libel was read by the public crier in a loud voice. It stated
that the governor had ordered them all to be deprived of their
possessions and to be treated as slaves: and that they, in the
general interests of liberty, had laid hands on his person.
When this libel had been read they called out, &ldquo;Sirs, cry,
Liberty, liberty, long live the king!&rdquo; And this was accordingly
done by their friends. After these proceedings they inveighed
against the governor, and many said, &ldquo;Come what may, let us
kill this tyrant who wished to ruin and destroy us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the fury of the population had somewhat calmed
down, they elected Domingo de Irala as deputy-governor
and captain general of the whole province. This man
had already been elected once before in the place of
Francisco Ruiz, once Don Pedro de Mendoza&rsquo;s deputy.
Ruiz had been in truth a good deputy-governor; but
against all justice, and from envy and malice, he was
deposed and Domingo de Irala elected in his stead. Someone
having said to the supervisor, Alonso Cabrera, that
they had acted badly in that case, because Francisco
Ruiz had colonized the country and been at great
pains to maintain it, he answered that they had acted
thus because Ruiz would not do what they wished, but
that Domingo de Irala, whose rank was less than their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">-&nbsp;244&nbsp;-</a></span>
own, would always do what they bade him; and for this
reason all the officers elected him. They appointed Pero
Diaz del Valle alcalde mayor, because he was a friend of
Domingo de Irala, and gave the insignia of alguazil to a
certain Bartolom&eacute; de la Marilla, a native of Truxillo, a friend
of Nuflo de Chaves, and to Sancho de Salinas, a native of
Cazalla.</p>

<p>Then the officers and Domingo de Irala made it known that
they intended fitting out a new expedition to the country
discovered by the governor, to search for gold and silver, and
sending it, when found, to His Majesty, in order that they might
be pardoned the crime they had committed. Should they
not succeed in finding gold, they would not return, as they
feared punishment; yet it might happen that they found so
much of the precious metal that the king, in return for it,
would make them a present of the country. By such means
as these they cajoled the people. However, everybody knew
enough of their misdeeds and their past and present conduct
to decline consenting to the proposed expedition. And
since then the majority of the people began to remonstrate
against the imprisonment of the governor. Then the
officers and newly-appointed magistrates began to maltreat
those who showed discontent at the governor&rsquo;s imprisonment.
They imprisoned them, deprived them of all their possessions,
and tormented them in every way. When these people took
refuge in the church, in order to avoid being arrested, they
stationed watchmen at the door, so that no provisions might
reach them. They punished those who attempted to relieve
them, disarmed all the inhabitants and harassed them by
every means in their power. They, moreover, said in public
that they would kill any persons who might show discontent
at the governor&rsquo;s imprisonment.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">FROM</span> that time tumults and dissensions
frequently arose among the people.
Those that were of the party of the
king denounced the rebel officers and
their partisans as traitors. These,
fearing the inhabitants, went armed
day and night; they built stockades and other works for
their defence, barricaded the streets, and withdrew into five
or six houses. The governor was confined in a small room
in the house of Garcia Vanegas, so as to have him in
their midst. The alcalde and alguazils daily searched the
houses immediately surrounding that in which the governor
was held a captive, for fear lest an attempt might be made to
enter them by means of mines. When the officers saw two
or three men of the governor&rsquo;s party talking together, they
would immediately raise the alarm, enter the place in
which governor Nu&ntilde;ez was confined, lay their hands on their
daggers, and swear that if an attempt were made to rescue
him they would cut off his head and throw it to his would-be
deliverers. They appointed four men, whom they considered
the bravest of their band, to stand ready armed with
poniards, and made them swear that on the first attempt
to rescue him in the name of His Majesty they would
immediately enter and behead him. These men were
posted so near the governor that he could hear them talking
and sharpening their daggers. These executioners were
Garcia Vanegas, Andres Hernandez, <i>el romo</i>, besides others.</p>

<p>Not only was the arrest of the governor the cause of general
tumult and dissension, there were also many private disputes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">-&nbsp;246&nbsp;-</a></span>
and lawsuits in consequence of the edicts which had followed.
Some said that the officers and their friends were traitors,
and had done wrong in arresting Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez; that they
had caused the ruin of the country as then appeared, and even
now appears to be the case. Others took the contrary view;
and they killed, wounded, and maimed one another. The
officers and their friends said that the partisans of the governor
and those who wished him set at liberty were traitors, and
should be punished as such; they forbade suspected persons
from talking together. Whenever they saw two men together
in the streets they drew out an act of inquest, and
arrested them in order to know what they were saying; and
if three or four collected together, they fell upon them
with their weapons. They had placed sentries on the roof of
the house in which the governor was confined, in two sentry-boxes,
that they might overlook the whole town and adjacent
country. Their spies, too, reported what was being done and
said in the town. At night, thirty armed men patrolled the
streets, arresting anybody they met, demanding to know
whither they were going, and for what purpose. As the
tumults and disorders increased, the officers and their
partisans became harassed, and begged the governor to give
an order to the people to keep the peace and not revolt; and
if necessary to fix a penalty for disobedience to this order.
The officers drafted this order for him to sign, but when he
had signed it they were advised not to publish it, because they
pretended that everybody had been in favour of his arrest.
For this reason the order was not published.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHILE</span> these events were happening the
governor was very ill in bed, and for
the sake of his health chains were
fastened round his feet; by his pillow
a candle burned, for the prison was
dark, no light being admitted, and so
damp that the grass grew under his bed; he had the
candle because he might want it at any moment. To
crown his miseries, they had searched among the whole
population for the man most evilly disposed towards him,
and they found one named Hernando de Sosa, whom the
governor had punished for striking an Indian chief. This
man was placed on guard in the same room with him.
The prison closed with two sliding doors furnished with
padlocks; the officers and their partisans watched him day
and night armed to the teeth; and there were upwards of
one hundred and fifty of them, all paid with his property.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this strict watch kept upon him, every
night, or every third night, an Indian woman who brought
him his supper conveyed him a letter written by one of his
friends, informing him of all that happened outside his
prison. They begged him to say what he wished them to do,
three parts of the people being determined to die with the
Indians in order to deliver him. They had feared to do this
because of the threats of the officers to kill him should an
attempt at a rescue be made. Seventy of those guarding him
were ready to join them and make themselves masters of the
principal entrance of the prison. They promised to defend
him till the arrival of his friends. The governor opposed
this project, because it could not easily be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">-&nbsp;248&nbsp;-</a></span>
without the slaughter of a large number of Christians.
Besides, when once the scheme had been put into execution,
the Indians would have put an end to the Christians and
brought about the final ruin of the country. For these
reasons he dissuaded them from their purpose.</p>

<p>The Indian woman who brought him a letter every third
night, and took back an answer, passed through the midst of
the guards, who stripped her naked, examined her mouth and
ears, and cut off her hair, for fear of her concealing anything.
They even searched her in parts which modesty compels me
not to mention. This woman, as I have stated, passed the
guard quite naked, and having come to where the governor
was, handed the gaoler what she brought, and then sat down
on his bed, for the room was small. She then began to scratch
her foot, and while engaged in this way, drew forth a letter
which she handed to the governor behind the back of the
gaoler. This letter, written on very thin paper, was deftly
rolled up and covered with black wax; this was concealed
under the lesser toes, and attached to these by two black
threads. In this way she brought the letters and the
necessary paper for him to write his answer, and a little
powder made of a certain black stone of the country, which,
moistened with a little saliva or water, made ink. The officers
and their friends suspected her, for they had learned that the
governor knew what was passing outside the prison, and
what they were doing. In order to be sure of this, they
chose four of the more youthful of their party to seduce the
Indian woman&mdash;not a difficult task, for these women are not
sparing of their charms, and consider it an affront to deny
their favours to anyone; they say, moreover, that they have
received them for that purpose. These four youths accordingly
intrigued with her and gave her many presents; but they
could never make her divulge her secret during the whole of
their intercourse, which lasted eleven months.</p>

<h4>How the insurgents ravaged the land and took possession of
the property of the inhabitants.</h4>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHILE</span> the governor was in this
situation, the officers and Domingo
de Irala gave public permission to
all their friends and partisans to go
into the villages and huts of the
Indians and take by force their wives,
daughters, hammocks, and other of their possessions, a thing
contrary to the service of His Majesty and the peace of the
country. While this was going on they would scour the
country, strike the Indians blows with sticks, carry them
off to their houses, and oblige them to labour in their fields
without any remuneration. When the Indians came and
complained to Domingo de Irala and the officers, these
answered that it was no affair of theirs, which pleased the
Christians, because they knew that this answer was given to
suit their pleasure and secure their support, for they might
say that they had full liberty to do what they liked. These
replies and bad treatment caused the country to be deserted.
The natives withdrew to the mountains, and concealed themselves
in places where the Christians could not find them. A
large number were Christians, together with wives and children.
When they left the settlement they lost the religious teaching
of the monks and clergy, the governor having paid great
attention to their religious instruction. A few days after his
arrest they destroyed the caravel which he had made to send
advice to His Majesty of all that was passing in the province;
for the insurgents hoped to get the people to undertake a
voyage of discovery in that country, where the governor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">-&nbsp;250&nbsp;-</a></span>
already partly explored; they thought they might obtain
gold and silver there, and that they would have the honour
of rendering important service to the king.</p>

<p>There being no justice in the land, the inhabitants and
colonists suffered many wrongs from the officers and
magistrates appointed by the insurgents. They were
imprisoned and deprived of their property; at least fifty
of them became so indignant that they retreated into the
interior towards the coast of Brazil, with the intention of
finding means of proceeding to Spain and informing His
Majesty of all the wrongs, misdeeds, and disturbances passing
in the land. Many others were overtaken and kept in
prison a long time; their arms and all their possessions
were taken away and distributed among their friends and
partisans, in order to engage their support for the party in
power.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHILE</span> this sad state of things was

the monks&mdash;friar Bernardo de Armenta<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
thinking the moment opportune
for putting into execution
their long-conceived project of departing
(having already attempted it, as I have said
before), spoke about it to the officers and to Domingo de
Irala, in order that they should give them permission and
the necessary help to reach the coast of Brazil. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">-&nbsp;251&nbsp;-</a></span>
officers consented, in order to give them satisfaction because
they had opposed the governor, who had hindered their
taking the route they wished. Permission was accordingly
granted to them, and the necessary help to go to Brazil.
They took with them some Spaniards and Indian women, to
whom they were teaching Christianity.</p>

<p>During his captivity the governor had asked the insurgents
several times to let him appoint a deputy to rule
the province in the name of His Majesty, in order to terminate
the tumults and disorders that were of such constant
occurrence, and restore justice and tranquillity in the land.
After making this nomination he would have liked to go
before the king and render an account of all that had passed,
and the actual position of affairs. The officers answered,
however, that by his arrest his authority had lost all its
force, and that the person they had nominated as governor
would serve the purpose. Every day they entered his prison
and threatened to put an end to his life. The governor
replied that, should they decide upon doing this, he begged,
and even if necessary he required, them in God&rsquo;s name and
the king&rsquo;s to send him a clergyman to confess him. They
said that if they gave him a confessor it would be Francisco
de Andrada, or another native of Biscay (who were concerned
in the insurrection), and if he would have neither of
them, he should have none at all, because the others were
their enemies and his supporters. In fact, they had arrested
Antonio d&rsquo;Escalera, Rodrigo de Herrera, and Luis de Miranda,
because they had said, and were still saying, that the arrest
of the governor was a great sin, and contrary to the service of
God and His Majesty, and would bring ruin upon the land.
The priest, Luis de Miranda, had been imprisoned with the
Alcalde mayor for more than eight months without seeing
sun or moon all that time. And the insurgents would never
consent that any other of the clergy except those we have
named should confess him.</p>

having been heard to say one day that he would form a
scheme to release the governor from prison, the officers and
Domingo de Irala had him arrested, and applied the torture
to him, to find pretext for punishing and ill-treating others
whom they hated. They offered him his liberty if he would
incriminate others whom he had named in his evidence.
These were all taken and disarmed. Anton Bravo was
publicly bastinadoed in the street, proclaimed a traitor,
and accused of being unfaithful to His Majesty by trying to
deliver the governor from prison.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THIS</span> was the cause of many other cruel
torturings to find out if the persons
accused had concerted measures for the
release of the governor from prison.
They sought to know who were the
persons concerned in the scheme, how
he was to be delivered, and if the ground were mined.
Many were deprived of the use of their limbs by these
tortures. Inscriptions having been found on the walls,
which said, &ldquo;Thou shalt die for thy king and thy law,&rdquo; the
officers, Domingo de Irala, and the magistrates, took steps
to find out who were the authors, swearing and threatening
to punish them, and they arrested a number of persons,
whom they put to the torture.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AFFAIRS</span> being in the state I have
described, a certain Pedro de Molina,
a native of Guadix, and judge of that
town, having been witness of the misfortunes
and troubles that were taking
place in the country, determined, in
His Majesty&rsquo;s interests, to enter the
stockaded enclosure where Domingo de Irala and his officers
were residing, and in the presence of all, doffing his cap, he
asked Martin de Ure, the notary, to read to the officers a
requisition that the evils, murders, and injustice occasioned
by the arrest of the governor might cease. He demanded
that Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez should be set free, and that he should
be allowed to invest some fitting person, with his authority,
to govern the province in the name of His Majesty, and
maintain peace and justice. The notary at first refused to
read it because the insurgents were present, but at length he
took it, and said to Pedro de Molina that if he wished it
read he must pay him his fee. Pedro de Molina drew his
sword and handed it to him. The notary declined the
sword as a pledge for payment. Then Pedro de Molina
took off his woollen hood and gave it to him, saying: &ldquo;Read
it, I have no better pledge to offer.&rdquo; Martin de Ure took the
hood and the requisition, and threw them both down at his
feet, declaring that he would not notify it to those gentlemen.
Thereupon Garcia Vanegas, the deputy-treasurer,
addressed some insulting words to Pedro de Molina, threatening
to have him beaten to death, and that he deserved it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">-&nbsp;254&nbsp;-</a></span>
daring to speak in that way. Pedro de Molina then went
out, raising his cap, considering himself fortunate in escaping
without further ill-treatment.</p>

<h4>How the insurgents gave the Indians permission to eat human
flesh.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">THE</span> officers and Domingo de Irala, wishing
to gain favour among the natives,
gave them permission to kill and eat
their Indian enemies. Many of those
who availed themselves of this license
were converted Christians. The insurgents
had adopted this expedient, unbecoming to the
service of God and His Majesty, and horrible to all who
knew of it, in order to prevent the Indians from leaving the
country, and attaching them to their party. They told
them the governor was a bad man, inasmuch as he would
not authorise their killing and eating their enemies, and
that he had been arrested on that account, and that they
now gave them free permission to do this.</p>

<p>In spite of all their efforts, the officers and Domingo de
Irala, seeing that the tumults and quarrels would not cease,
but were daily on the increase, decided to remove the
governor from the province, while those who took this step
chose to remain where they were and not return to Spain;
they only desired to expel him and some of his friends.
The partisans of the governor, on hearing this resolution,
were much excited. They said that since the officers had
usurped the power of deposing the governor and arresting
him, and had given their supporters to understand that they
would go with him to Spain, to explain their conduct to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">-&nbsp;255&nbsp;-</a></span>
His Majesty, they must keep their promise, and if they all
refused to go, that two, at all events, should accompany
him, and that the other two might remain in the province.
So they arranged it in that way, and, in order to take him
to Spain, they equipped one of the brigantines which he had
built for exploring and conquering the country. This gave
rise to serious altercations, owing to the discontent that
prevailed at seeing they were about to take Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez
from the province. The officers resolved upon arresting the
leaders of the malcontents, but durst not carry out their
intention. In this dilemma they had again recourse to the
governor, conjuring him to put an end to all the scandals
and disorders; that if his friends would give their word not
to attempt his release, that they on their side, and their
magistrates, would promise not to arrest anybody, or do any
injury to anybody, and would set those free whom they had
arrested, and they swore it. As the governor had now been
in prison a long time, and nobody had seen him, it was
suspected and feared that they had secretly murdered him.
They were accordingly asked to allow two monks and two
gentlemen to enter his prison and see him, so that they
might certify the people he was still alive. The officers
promised they would do this three or four days before it
was time for him to embark, but they broke their word.</p>

<h3><a name="EIGHTY-THIRD" id="EIGHTY-THIRD">CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-THIRD.</a></h3>

<h4>How the insurgents had to write to His Majesty and send
him a report.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="100" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="ltrspc">AT</span> this juncture the officers prepared
several memoirs to send to Spain,
accusing the governor and making him
odious to everybody. To lend a favourable
colour to their own criminal acts,
they wrote things that never happened
and were entirely untrue. While the
brigantine was being equipped for her voyage, the friends of
the governor arranged with the carpenters to hollow a timber
as big as a man&rsquo;s thigh, and three spans long, and place
inside it a general act of accusation which the governor
had addressed to His Majesty, and other important papers
collected by his friends when he was arrested. This packet
was taken and enveloped in a waxed cloth, and the piece of
timber was fastened to the poop of the brigantine with six
nails above and six below. The carpenters said that they
had placed it there to strengthen the brigantine, and the
secret was kept so well that nobody discovered it. The
master carpenter told a sailor of it, so that when the vessel
arrived in Spain the documents might be taken out. It had
been arranged with the officers that the governor should be
seen by his friends before he embarked, but neither Captain
Salazar nor anybody saw him. One night, towards midnight,
Alonso Cabrera, the supervisor, and Pedro Dorantes, his
factor, accompanied by a large number of arquebusiers,
presented themselves at the prison; and each arquebusier
carried three lighted fuses in his hand, so as to make the
number appear greater than it was. Then Alonso Cabrera
and Pedro Dorantes entered the room in which he lay; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">-&nbsp;257&nbsp;-</a></span>
seized him by the arm and lifted him out of the bed with the
chains round his feet; he was very ill, almost to death.
They carried him in this state to the gate leading into the
street, and when he saw the sky, which he had not seen till
then, he entreated them to let him render thanks to God.
When he rose from his knees, two soldiers took him under
the arms and carried him on board the brigantine, for he was
extremely weak and crippled. When he saw himself in the
midst of these people, he said to them: &ldquo;Sirs, be my witnesses
that I appoint, as my deputy, Juan de Salazar de
Espinosa, that he may govern this province instead of me,
and in the name of His Majesty, maintaining order and justice
till the King should have been pleased to make other dispositions.&rdquo;
Hardly had he finished speaking than Garcia Vanegas,
deputy treasurer, rushed upon him, dagger in hand, saying:
&ldquo;I do not recognise what you say; retract, or I will tear
your soul from your body.&rdquo; The governor had, however,
been advised not to say what he did, because they were
determined to kill him, and these words might have
occasioned a great disturbance among them, and the party
of the King might have snatched him from the hands of the
others, everybody being then in the street. Garcia Vanegas
having withdrawn a little, the governor repeated the same
words; then Garcia sprang with great fury on the governor,
and placed a dagger to his temple, saying to him as before:
&ldquo;Withdraw what you have said, or I will tear your soul
from your body.&rdquo; At the same moment he inflicted a slight
wound on his temple, and pushed the people who were carrying
the governor with so much violence that they fell with him,
and one of them dropped his cap. After this they quickly
raised him again, and carried him precipitately on board the
brigantine. They closed the poop of the vessel with planks,
put two chains on him which prevented him from moving;
then they unmoored and descended the river.</p>

<p>Two days after the embarkation of the governor and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">-&nbsp;258&nbsp;-</a></span>
departure of the brigantine, Domingo de Irala, the accountant
Philip de Caceres, and the factor Pedro Dorantes assembled
their friends and attacked the house of Captain Salazar.
They seized him and Pedro de Estopi&ntilde;an Cabeza de Vaca,
put them in irons, and sent them down the river to
overtake the brigantine. These two officers were taken to
Spain with him, and it is certain that if Captain Salazar had
wished it the governor would not have been arrested, and
still less would they have been able to take him out of
the country and carry him to Castille; but, as he remained
deputy governor, his conduct was not altogether frank.
Cabeza de Vaca begged that two of his servants might be
allowed to accompany him to prepare his food and attend
upon him during the voyage. Accordingly they let the two
servants go, not however to wait on him, but to row four hundred
leagues on the river, for none could be found willing to
do this work. They forced some of the people to come, others
fled into the interior, and the property of such was confiscated
and distributed among those that were pressed for the service.
The officers did a very wrong thing during the voyage, and it
was this: every two or three days they spread among their
partisans and their friends a thousand calumnies against
him, and finally said: &ldquo;We have, as it is manifest, done you
a great deal of good and acted for your advantage and that
of the king, in consideration for this, sign this paper.&rdquo; In
this way they filled four quires of paper with signatures, and
during the voyage down the river composed their calumnious
statements while these who had signed their names to the
paper remained at Ascension, three hundred leagues up the
river. It was upon this document that the charges brought
against the governor were framed.</p>

<h4>How they gave arsenic three times to the governor
during the voyage.</h4>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="ltrspc">WHILE</span> descending the river the officers
ordered a certain Biscayan named
Machin to prepare the food for the
governor and then to pass it to Lope
Duarte, one of the confederates of
Domingo de Irala, and guilty, like the
rest, of complicity in his arrest. He
came from Spain as solicitor to Domingo de Irala and to
attend to his affairs. While the governor journeyed in
this fashion, arsenic was administered to him three times;
but as an antidote against this poison he carried with
him a bottle of oil and a piece of the horn of a
unicorn. When he felt unwell he made use of these
remedies; day and night his sufferings were great. But
it pleased God that he escaped safely. He entreated the
officers, Alonso Cabrera and Garcia Vanegas, to allow his own
servants to cook for him, as he would take his meals from
nobody else. To this they replied that he would have to
take his food from whomsoever they chose; if he did not take
it from the persons commissioned to give it him, he might die
of hunger, it mattered little to them. He abstained from
food several days, but hunger at length compelled him to
take what they gave him. The insurgents had promised
several persons to take them on board the caravel (afterwards
destroyed) to Spain if they would support their faction and
help them to arrest the governor and not oppose them. Two
of these were Francisco de Paredes, a native of Burgos, and
Friar Juan de Salazar, of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy.
They carried as prisoners with them Luis de Miranda, Pedro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">-&nbsp;260&nbsp;-</a></span>
Hernandez, Captain Salazar de Espinosa, and Pedro Vaca.
Having descended the river to the island of San Gabriel,
they would not allow either Francisco de Paredes or friar
Juan de Salazar to remain on board, fearing lest these two
persons should support the governor&rsquo;s cause in Spain, and
give a true account of what had happened. For this reason
they compelled them to re-embark on the brigantines that
returned up the river to Ascension, although they had sold
their houses and property for much less than they were
worth when they were compelled to leave. This caused
them to make such an outcry that it was pitiable to hear
them. Here the servants of the governor, who had accompanied
him thus far, rowing all the way, were obliged
to leave him, a loss he felt more than anything he
had yet endured; nor did they feel the separation less
acutely. They remained two days at the island of San
Gabriel, when some of them left for Ascension, and the
others for Spain. The brigantine which bore the governor
had eleven banks of rowers, and contained twenty-seven
persons altogether.</p>

<p>They pursued their voyage down the river till they entered
the sea, when a violent tempest arose. The brigantine
became waterlogged, and all the provisions were spoilt; all
that they managed to preserve was a little flour, some lard,
fish, and a little water. They were all very near being
drowned. The officers who had charge of the governor said
that God had sent them this terrible tempest as a punishment
for the wrongs and injustice they had made their
prisoner suffer. They resolved, therefore, to take off his
chains and let him out of prison. Alonso de Cabrera filed
them asunder, Garcia Vanegas kissed his feet, though Cabeza
de Vaca would not allow it. They said openly that God
had sent them those four days&rsquo; sufferings as a retribution for
the wrongs they had done him. They acknowledged they
had grievously wronged him, and that all their depositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">-&nbsp;261&nbsp;-</a></span>
were false; that the malice and jealousy they bore him
prompted them to administer two thousand false oaths, and
this because in three days he had discovered a country and
a route, while those who had lived in the country for twelve
years had not been able to accomplish it; and they implored
his pardon, and that he would not inform His Majesty how
they had arrested him. As soon as they had taken the
chains off the governor the sea and wind subsided, and the
tempest, which had lasted four days, calmed down. We
navigated in the open sea for 2,500 leagues without having
sight of land, and seeing nothing but water and sky. All
the food we had was a flour-cake fried in a little lard, with
a little water to drink. We were obliged to break off the
planks of our vessel to make a fire to cook our cake. In
this way, with infinite suffering, we arrived at the Azores,
belonging to His most serene Majesty of Portugal, the
voyage having lasted three months. We should not have
suffered so severely from hunger had we touched on the
Brazilian coast, or at the island of St. Domingo, in the
Indies; but the officers dared not do this, for they felt
guilty and dreaded being arrested and brought to justice as
rebels against their king. On arriving at the Azores the
officers in charge of the governor separated because of the
dissensions they had had, and each went his own way; but
first they tried to induce the justice of Angra to arrest the
governor, so as to prevent him from giving information to
His Majesty of the crimes and disorders they had committed.
They alleged that when he passed Cape Verd he
had pillaged the port and country. The judge having heard
their deposition, told them to be gone, for his king would
not allow himself to be robbed, and did not keep his ports
in such a weak state of defence that anybody might dare to
attack them. Having seen that, in spite of their malice,
they could do nothing to detain him, they embarked, and
arrived in Spain eight days before the governor, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-&nbsp;262&nbsp;-</a></span>
delayed by contrary winds. Being the first to present themselves
at court, they gave out that Cabeza de Vaca had gone
to the King of Portugal to inform him about those countries
beyond the sea. A few days later the governor arrived at
court. The night of his arrival all the guilty parties disappeared;
they went straight to Madrid, where they hoped to
find the court, as, in fact, they did. Meanwhile the Bishop
of Cuenca, who presided over the council of the Indies,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> died.
This prelate would have punished the crimes and treason
committed against His Majesty in that country. Some days
afterwards the officers and the governor were released, on
giving bail that they would not leave the jurisdiction of the
court. Garcia de Vanegas, who was one of those who had
arrested the governor, died a sudden, terrible death, his eyes
having fallen out of his head, and he never declared the
truth of what had passed. Alonso Cabrera, the supervisor,
his accomplice, lost his reason, and in a fit of frenzy he killed
his wife at Loxa. The friars who had taken part in the
revolt and troubles also died suddenly, which seemed to
show the small blame attaching to the governor in his
conduct towards them. After keeping him eight years
under arrest at court, he was set at liberty and acquitted.
He was relieved of his governorship for divers reasons; for
his enemies said that if he returned to punish the guilty,
he would have occasioned more troubles and dissensions
in that country. He therefore lost his appointment, besides
other losses, without receiving any compensation for all the
money he had spent in relieving the Spaniards, and in his
voyage of discovery.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="ltrspc">IN</span> the city of Ascension, which is by the
river Paraguai, in the province of Rio
de la Plata, on the 3rd March, in the
year of Our Lord, 1545, appeared
before me, public notary, and the
legal witnesses, being in the church
and monastery of Our Lady of Mercy, Redeemer of captives,
Captain Hernando de Ribera, conquistador in this province,
and deposed as follows: When Se&ntilde;or Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza
de Vaca, governor and adelantado and captain-general in
the name of His Majesty, of the province of Rio de la Plata,
was in the port of Los Reyes, whence he started on his
exploration last year (1543), he commissioned me to take
one brigantine, and a certain number of men, and explore
up a certain river called Ygatu, which is an arm of two
great rivers, viz., the Yacareati and the Yaiva, flowing, according
to the reports of the Indians, through the settlements
of the interior; and I, Hernando de Ribera, having arrived
at some Indians called Xarayes, in consequence of information
received from them, left the brigantine in a safe haven,
and entered the interior of the country with forty men, in
order to see and examine it with my own eyes. And having
pursued my journey past many Indian settlements, and
obtained from their inhabitants and other natives who came
to see me, full reports touching the land, I examined and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">-&nbsp;264&nbsp;-</a></span>
sifted these statements, in order to learn the truth, being
moreover, acquainted with the language of the Carios, and
therefore able to hold intercourse with those tribes.</p>

<p>Juan Valderas, royal notary, whom I had with me at this
time, wrote down and made a note of certain things relating
to that discovery. Yet I would not tell him the whole truth
concerning the riches and the settlements of the various
tribes inhabiting those regions, lest he should write it in
his report. And he, the said notary, did not know, nor did
he fully understand the matter, for my intention was at
that time to have communicated it directly to the governor,
in order that he might forthwith proceed to the conquest
of that land, as it beseemed the service of God and His
Majesty.</p>

<p>After penetrating several days&rsquo; journey into the interior,
I was obliged to return to the port of Los Reyes, in compliance
with orders sent me by the governor. And because
I found him and all his people sick on my arrival, I had no
opportunity of reporting my discovery, nor communicating
all the information I had collected from the natives. A few
days afterwards he was compelled to return to Ascension
to save the lives of his people, and having again fallen sick
a few days after his arrival in that city, he was arrested by
the officers of His Majesty (as everybody knows), so that I
was unable to make my statement.</p>

<p>Seeing that the officers of His Majesty are about to return
to Spain with the governor, and fearing that he may in the
meanwhile die, or be removed to some other place where the
report might not be delivered to him, and that His Majesty&rsquo;s
service might in this way suffer loss, and the governor himself
be prejudiced, and that I might be held blameworthy&mdash;taking
all this, I say, into consideration, and for the discharge
of my conscience, now I, in order to serve God and the King,
and the governor in his name, desire to make a declaration
of the said discovery, that His Majesty may know of it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">-&nbsp;265&nbsp;-</a></span>
the reports I obtained from the natives. I have therefore
asked and required the notary to receive my statement,
which is as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Captain Hernando de Ribera, say and declare that on
the 20th of December last year (1543), I set out from the
port of Los Reyes in the brigantine <i>El Golondrino</i> (&lsquo;The
Swallow&rsquo;) with fifty-two men, in obedience to the governor&rsquo;s
orders, and went on navigating the river Ygatu, which is
an arm of the aforesaid two rivers Yacareati and Yaiva, and
is very wide and voluminous; and on the sixth day I entered
the parent stream of these two water-courses. According to
the reports of the natives where I happened to land, these
two rivers come from the interior of the country, the Yaiva
most probably from the Sierras of Santa Martha. This
river is wide and deep, and greater than the Yacareati, which
according to the Indians, flows from the Peruvian Sierras;
and between those two water-courses there is a wide expanse
of land, and innumerable villages and tribes. According to
the natives, the Yaiva and the Yacareati unite in the country
of the Indians called Perobazanes, and there they separate
again, and seventy leagues lower down they reunite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After navigating that river for seventeen days, I passed
through the land of the Perobazanes, and arrived at another
country, where the inhabitants are called Xarayes. These
people are agriculturists, have a quantity of provisions, and
rear geese, fowls, and other birds. They fish and hunt, and
are a reasonable people, obeying their chief. Being in one of
their settlements, consisting of about a thousand houses,
and well received by their chief, Camire, I collected information
concerning the settlements of the interior. In
consequence of that information, I left the brigantine under
the care of ten men, and taking a guide from the said
Xarayes, advanced three days inland, till I reached the
settlements of a tribe of Indians, called Urtueses, a good
people, cultivating the soil like the Xarayes. From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">-&nbsp;266&nbsp;-</a></span>
place, I went on through an inhabited country, till I reached
fourteen degrees twenty minutes going westwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While staying in the settlements of the Urtueses and
Aburu&ntilde;es, many chiefs of tribes farther inland came and
spoke with me, and brought feathers, like those of Peru, and
metal plates in the rough. From them I also obtained
information, questioning each individually concerning the
settlements and tribes beyond. All these Indians told me
that at ten days&rsquo; march from there, towards the west-north-west,
there were women inhabiting large villages, who
possessed a large quantity of white and yellow metal, and
all their domestic utensils and vessels were of this metal,
and their chief was a woman. They are a warlike people,
much feared by the Indians. Before reaching those female
warriors it is necessary to pass a tribe of very small Indians,
who make war upon the women, and also upon those Indians
who gave the information. At a certain time of the year
these women unite with their neighbours, and cohabit with
them. And if the children born of this intercourse be girls,
the mothers keep them; if they are boys, they send them as
soon as they are weaned to their fathers. On the other side
of the settlements of these women, bordering with them,
there are very large villages and tribes of Indians. These
statements they made of their own free will, without my
asking them. They talked also of a large lake, which
they call the House of the Sun, because they say the sun
locks himself in there, and said that these women lived
there between the flanks of Santa Martha and the lake on
the west-north-west, and that beyond the settlements of
those women were other large nations of black people.
According to the description they gave, these negroes are
eagle-faced, with pointed beards like the Moors. We asked
them how they knew those people to be black, and they
answered that their fathers had seen them and other tribes
living in that neighbourhood had reported it. These people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">-&nbsp;267&nbsp;-</a></span>
clothe themselves, and have houses of stone and earth; they
are tall, and possess white and yellow metal in such abundance
that they make use of no other material for their
domestic utensils and vases, and all kinds of great vessels.
We asked where those black people lived, and they pointed
to the north-west, saying, that should we wish to go there, we
might reach their settlements in fifteen days. And it seemed
to me, judging from the indications given by the Indians,
that those settlements lie in twelve degrees towards the
north-west, between the sierras of Santa Martha and
Mara&ntilde;on. They are a race of warriors fighting with bows
and arrows. The same Indians also gave us to understand
that between west-north-west and north-west, one quarter
north, there are many tribes of Indians with such large
settlements that it is a day&rsquo;s journey to pass from one end
to the other; and all are rich in white and yellow metal, and
wear clothes. They may be reached in a short time, always
passing through inhabited country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farther to the west there is a large lake, so wide that it is
impossible to see from shore to shore, and by its side dwells
a nation who wear clothes, and possess much metal and
brilliant stones, which they work into the borders of their
dress; and they find these stones in the lake. They have
large villages, are agriculturists, and have stores of provisions,
besides an abundance of geese and other birds. From
the place where I was they said I might reach the lake and
its settlements in fifteen days, always travelling through
inhabited country, abounding in metal, and by good roads.
They offered to show us the way thither when the floods
subsided, though we were but few Christians, and the settlements
we should have to pass were very large and populous.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-&nbsp;268&nbsp;-</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I also formally declare that the Indians showed me by
signs that in the direction west, one quarter south-west, there
are large towns, with houses built of earth, inhabited by a
good people, clothed, very rich, and possessing plenty of
metal. They rear a large number of great sheep, using these
for agriculture and transport. I asked if those people were
far off, and they answered that the route thither lay through
a thickly inhabited country, and that it was not far. Among
those people they said there were other Christians, and great
waterless deserts of sand. We asked them how they knew
there were Christians on that side, and they answered, that
in times gone by the Indians living in that neighbourhood
had been heard to say that as they were passing the desert
they met many white people, clothed, with beards, and
they had certain animals with them (evidently, according to
their showing, horses), and riders on their backs, and that
owing to the want of water they had returned, and many
had died on the way. The Indians thought they had come
from the other side of the desert. They showed us also, by
signs, that in the direction west, one quarter south, there
were high mountains, and an uninhabited country. Having
heard that there were people dwelling beyond those deserts,
the Indians had attempted to pass that way, but were unable
to proceed, because they died of hunger and thirst. We
asked them how they came to learn all this, and they
answered, that all the Indians of this country communicated
with one another, and it had been related how those Indians
had seen the Christians and their horses crossing the desert.
They said, too, that on the south-west skirt of those mountains
there were many large settlements, and people rich in
metal; and beyond these again lay the salt water and the
great ships. We asked them if those settlements were
ruled by separate chiefs, and they answered, that there was
only one chief who ruled all the towns, and was obeyed by
all. I further declare, that in order to verify their statements
I questioned each of them separately for a day and a night,
and they always repeated the same story without any variation
whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above statement was made by Hernando de Ribera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-&nbsp;269&nbsp;-</a></span>
who said and declared that he had received it with all clearness,
faithfully and loyally, without fraud and deceit; and
in order that all credit and faith should be given to it, and
that there should not be the slightest doubt concerning it, or
any portion thereof, he said he would swear to the truth of
it, and he swore in the name of God and Santa Maria, and
on the four sacred gospels, upon which he placed his right hand,
a missal being held open for that purpose by the reverend
father, Francisco Gonzalez Paniagua, at the very place where
the sacred gospels are written, and on the sign of the cross,
like this: <span class="symbol">&#x2720;</span>, where he also placed his right hand to testify that
the aforesaid statement, according to the form and manner
of it, was given, said, and declared by the Indian chiefs of
the aforesaid land, and by other aged men whom he had
diligently examined and interrogated in order to learn the
truth, and have a clear understanding of the interior of the
country.</p>

<p>After he had obtained this information, other Indians of
different settlements came to see him, especially of a large
village, called Uretabere. He went one day&rsquo;s march in their
territory, and collected information wherever he went, and
all the statements agreed. He declared, moreover, under
the sanctity of his oath, that there was no exaggeration or
imagination in anything he had said, nothing but the
truth, without fraud or reservation whatsoever. He also
declared that the Indians assured him that the river
Yacareati has a fall from a high mountain.</p>

<p>This he certifies to be true, so help him God, and if it be
otherwise may he pay dear in this world with his body, and
in the next with his soul. This oath having been read out
to him, he said: &ldquo;I swear it, Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The aforesaid captain asked and required me to testify
to this statement, as much for his peace of mind as to serve
as evidence for the aforesaid governor, and to preserve his
rights; the following being witnesses: the aforesaid reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">-&nbsp;270&nbsp;-</a></span>
father Paniagua; Sebastian de Valdivieso, valet of the said
governor; Gaspar de Hortigosa and Juan de Hoces, citizens
of Cordoba, all of whom have signed their names as follows:
Francisco Gonzalez Paniagua, Sebastian de Valdivieso,
Juan de Hoces, Hernando de Ribera, Gaspar de Hortigosa.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
